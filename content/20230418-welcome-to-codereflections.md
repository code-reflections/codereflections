Welcome to CodeReflections, a blog dedicated to exploring programming
languages, tools, and best practices.  I'm looking forward to posting about
topics of interest to me, and I hope you find them interesting too!

<!-- more -->

I've been wanting to create a blog like this for many years now, and finally
got around to doing it. Better late than never, right?

Since this is an introductory post, I'll try to describe what to expect from
this blog.  Currently, I'm expecting that Perl and Rust will likely be the
primary focus of this blog, simply because both languages are of special
interest to me.  Of course, this may change over time, and I certainly won't
hesitate to post about other topics of interest to me.  I've always been a
programming polyglot, having used dozens of languages over the years, so
anything goes!

Perl has been my favorite programming language for well over 30 years now.
While I can't pin down precisely when I started using Perl, my best estimate
would be sometime in 1989 or so.  I know for certain that I was using Perl in
early 1990, and by early 1991 it was my favorite programming language and an
indispensable tool for me.  (There's a story there which I'll save for a future
blog post.)

Rust is a more recent passion for me.  I started looking into Rust in 2019, and
quickly became very interested.  I'll get into more detail later, but suffice
it to say that apart from Raku (nÃ©e Perl 6), Rust is the first language I've
found that feels like it has the potential to displace Perl as my favorite
programming language.  It hasn't happened yet, but it's a distinct possibility.

One of my favorite quotes comes from Alan Kay: "Simple things should be simple,
and complex things should be possible."  This has always been my philosophy
about programming in general, so I made it the tagline for this blog.

Lately, I've been experimenting with ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by
OpenAI.  It's a fascinating tool which is surprisingly capable and intelligent
on the one hand, yet surprisingly dumb or hallucinatory at times as well.  It
can be a very useful tool, but it should not be trusted blindly.  Still, it's
nothing like conversations with Eliza back in the day; ChatGPT could probably
pass the Turing Test!

In the process of creating this blog, I've been using ChatGPT as a tool to help
with research, brainstorming and also just as a sounding board to bounce ideas
off of.  (That's really an odd turn of phrase, isn't it?)  Consider this a
disclaimer that ChatGPT may be used as a tool when creating any of the content
on this blog, but rest assured that the thoughts and opinions here are my own.
I won't hesitate to discard or rewrite anything ChatGPT suggests.

For example, I told ChatGPT to "Help me write the first post for the blog."
I wanted to see what it would come up with, and use it as a starting point to
work from.  For the sake of transparency, here is the exact draft that ChatGPT
gave me in response:

> Title: Welcome to CodeReflections: A Journey in Programming
>
> Hello, fellow programmers and tech enthusiasts! Welcome to CodeReflections, a
> blog dedicated to exploring programming languages, tools, and best practices.
> I'm thrilled to embark on this journey with you all, and I hope that together
> we can learn, grow, and share our passion for programming.
>
> To kick things off, let's talk about the purpose of this blog and what you
> can expect to find here. CodeReflections is primarily focused on Perl and
> Rust, two languages I personally love working with. However, as a programming
> polyglot, I won't limit the discussion to just these two languages. You can
> expect to see content related to various programming languages, tools,
> libraries, and techniques.
>
> As Alan Kay once said, "Simple things should be simple, and complex things
> should be possible." This quote perfectly encapsulates the philosophy behind
> this blog. I believe that good programming practices should enable us to make
> simple tasks simple and give us the tools to tackle complex challenges when
> needed.
>
> Here's what you can expect from CodeReflections:
>
> Tutorials and Guides: Easy-to-follow explanations and practical examples to
> help you learn new concepts, tools, and libraries.
>
> Code Optimization: Tips and tricks for writing efficient, elegant, and
> maintainable code.
>
> Language Comparisons: Analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of different
> programming languages and how they can be utilized in various projects.
>
> Best Practices: Discussions on design patterns, testing methodologies, and
> other practices to help you become a better programmer.
>
> Personal Insights: As I explore new languages, tools, and techniques, I'll
> share my thoughts and experiences in hopes that they might resonate with you
> or spark a conversation.
>
> In the spirit of open-source, I welcome contributions and discussions from
> the community. If you have any suggestions, comments, or questions, feel free
> to leave a comment or reach out to me via social media.

> Happy coding!

Pretty good, right?  Honestly, I don't disagree with anything above, but it
still sounds a bit generic to me.  As you can see, I've deviated quite a bit
from this suggested draft.  While ChatGPT's suggestions sound fine to me
(Tutorials and Guides, Code Optimization, Language Comparisons, Best Practices
and Personal Insights), I don't know how accurate that list might be.  Time
will tell.

I figure that I might as well explore reasonable monetization options for this
blog.  I'm not going to hold my breath hoping to make a living as a blogger,
but every little bit helps, right?  It's worth a try, so I instructed ChatGPT
to "Add a paragraph with a suitable disclosure for possible monetization (e.g.
ads/affiliate links/sponsorships) and use of ChatGPT."

Here's what ChatGPT wrote:

> In the interest of transparency, I want to inform you that CodeReflections
> may be monetized in the future through advertisements, affiliate links, and
> sponsorships. These monetization methods help support the creation and
> maintenance of this blog. Any such content will always be clearly identified,
> and I promise to maintain a high standard of quality in my posts. Rest
> assured that my priority is to provide valuable and unbiased content to my
> readers. Additionally, some of the content on this blog, including this post,
> has been drafted with the assistance of ChatGPT, an AI language model
> developed by OpenAI. This tool aids me in generating ideas and refining the
> content, but the thoughts and opinions expressed here are my own.

Sure, I guess this works.  No notes.

That's enough for now.  As ChatGPT said: Happy coding!
