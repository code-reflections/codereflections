I started working on formatting ChatGPT conversations in [my last
post](/2023/06/23/formatting-chatgpt-conversations/), but along the way, I also
stumbled across another problem with the website design.  The DeepThought theme
comes with a dark mode button, but I found that clicking it turned my avatar
into some weird inverse color image.  I decided to take a detour to research
this issue...

<!-- more -->

{{ first_msg() }}

Hmm, if I click the button in the upper-right corner from the DeepThought
theme, to switch the page to Dark Mode, it also turns the image of my avatar
into some sort of weird color inverse video.  How do I prevent this?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

The color inversion of your avatar in Dark Mode is likely caused by a CSS rule
that targets images or background images and applies a filter to invert their
colors. To prevent this from happening to your avatar, you can add a CSS rule
to exclude your avatar from being affected by the filter.

You should look for the CSS rules that apply to Dark Mode (usually they are
inside a media query or a selector with a class like **\`.dark\`**), then find
the rule that inverts the colors.

Once you find the rule that causes the color inversion, you can add a more
specific rule for your avatar to override the effect. Here's an example of how
to do this:

```css
/* Assuming the rule that inverts colors looks like this */
.dark img {
  filter: invert(1);
}

/* Add a more specific rule to exclude the ChatGPT avatar */
.dark .chatgpt-message::before {
  filter: invert(0);
}
```

The code above assumes that the Dark Mode rules are applied using the
**\`.dark\`** class. Adjust the selectors according to your theme's structure.
By setting the **\`filter\`** property to **\`invert(0)\`** for your avatar,
you disable the inversion effect and prevent it from being affected by the Dark
Mode color inversion.

{{ user_msg() }}

Would a "!important" rule be better?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Using **\`!important\`** can also work in this situation, but it's generally
recommended to avoid using it when possible, as it can lead to maintenance
issues and make it more difficult to override styles in the future. It's better
to use more specific selectors instead, as they tend to create more
maintainable and structured CSS.

However, if you're having trouble overriding the color inversion using more
specific selectors, or you prefer a quick solution, you can use
\`**!important\`**. Here's how to apply it in your case:

```css
.chatgpt-message::before {
  filter: invert(0) !important;
}
```

By adding **\`!important\`** to the **\`filter\`** property, you ensure that
this rule takes precedence over any other rule that sets the **\`filter\`**
property for the **\`.chatgpt-message::before\`** selector. Keep in mind that
using **\`!important\`** should be a last resort, and it's better to try more
specific selectors first.

{{ user_msg() }}

This appears to be the source of the problem, in
"themes/DeepThought/sass/deep-thought.sass":

body[theme="dark"]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Thank you for providing the source of the problem. In this case, the dark theme
is using a filter to invert the colors and apply a hue rotation to the entire
body, which is causing the issue with your avatar. To prevent this, you can
override the filter specifically for your avatar element.

If your avatar is contained within an element with a specific class or ID, you
can target that selector and reset the filter. Let's say your avatar is inside
an element with a class of **\`.avatar\`**. You can add the following CSS rule:

```css
body[theme="dark"] .avatar {
  filter: invert(0) hue-rotate(0deg);
}
```

This rule will reset the filter applied to the **\`.avatar\`** element when the
dark theme is active. Make sure to replace **\`.avatar\`** with the correct
selector that targets your avatar element.

If your avatar is using the **\`.chatgpt-message::before\`** pseudo-element,
you can modify the rule like this:

```css
body[theme="dark"] .chatgpt-message::before {
  filter: invert(0) hue-rotate(0deg);
}
```

This will prevent the color inversion and hue rotation from being applied to
the avatar when the dark theme is enabled.

How does the SASS file translate into CSS?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a CSS preprocessor that extends
the capabilities of CSS by allowing variables, nested rules, mixins, and more.
SASS files need to be compiled into CSS files for browsers to interpret and
apply the styles.

Here's a basic example of how SASS translates into CSS:

**SASS:**

```sass
$primary-color: #3498db

body
  background-color: $primary-color

  h1
    color: darken($primary-color, 20%)
```

**Compiled CSS:**

```css
body {
  background-color: #3498db;
}

body h1 {
  color: #1c5a87;
}
```

In the SASS file, we defined a variable **\`$primary-color\`** and used it to
set the **\`background-color\`** property for the **\`body\`** element. The
**\`h1\`** elements inside the **\`body\`** get their **\`color\`** property
set to a darker version of the **\`$primary-color\`** using the **\`darken\`**
function.

When the SASS file is compiled, it generates the corresponding CSS file. The
variables, functions, and nested rules are resolved into standard CSS syntax
that can be interpreted by browsers.

To compile SASS files into CSS, you can use command-line tools like
**\`sass\`** (Dart Sass) or **\`node-sass\`**, or integrated tools in task
runners like Grunt, Gulp, or Webpack.

{{ user_msg() }}

It looks like the CSS file just contains body[theme=dark]{filter:invert(1)
hue-rotate(180deg)}

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

If the compiled CSS file contains the following rule:

```css
body[theme="dark"] {
  filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);
}
```

This rule targets the **\`body\`** element when it has an attribute
**\`theme\`** set to **\`"dark"\`**. When this condition is met, it applies a
filter that inverts the colors (with **\`invert(1)\`**) and rotates the hue by
180 degrees (with **\`hue-rotate(180deg)\`**).

This rule is causing the color inversion issue with your avatar image when the
dark mode is activated.

To prevent this issue, you can add a more specific rule to target only the
avatar image and cancel the filter applied by the **\`body[theme="dark"]\`**
rule. Add the following CSS rule to your custom CSS file:

```css
body[theme="dark"] .your-avatar-selector {
  filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);
}
```

Replace **\`.your-avatar-selector\`** with the actual selector (class, ID, or
element) that targets your avatar image. This rule will apply the same filter
to the avatar image, effectively canceling the filter applied by the
**\`body[theme="dark"]\`** rule, and preserving the original appearance of your
avatar image.

{{ last_msg() }}

Looks like ChatGPT is getting confused again...

{{ first_msg() }}

invert(1)?  You said invert(0) before.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Apologies for the confusion. You are correct. To cancel the filter applied by
the **\`body[theme="dark"]\`** rule, you should use **\`invert(0)\`** and
**\`hue-rotate(0deg)\`**. Here's the correct CSS rule:

```css
body[theme="dark"] .your-avatar-selector {
  filter: invert(0) hue-rotate(0deg);
}
```

Replace **\`.your-avatar-selector\`** with the actual selector (class, ID, or
element) that targets your avatar image. This rule will effectively cancel the
filter applied by the **\`body[theme="dark"]\`** rule and preserve the original
appearance of your avatar image when the dark mode is activated.

{{ user_msg() }}

This didn't work:

.user-message::before {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');<br>
}

body[theme="dark"] .user-message::before {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;filter: invert(0) hue-rotate(0deg);<br>
}

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

I apologize for the confusion earlier. In this case, since the avatar is being
used as a background image, we'll have to create an additional wrapper element
for the avatar and apply the filter on that element. Here's a modified
approach:

<span>1.</span> Wrap the avatar inside a separate div element with a class (for
example, **\`avatar-wrapper\`**):

```html
<div class="avatar-wrapper">
  <div class="user-message"></div>
</div>
```

<span>1.</span> Modify your CSS to apply the background image to the
**\`.avatar-wrapper\`** element and add the filter to cancel the dark mode
effect:

```css
.avatar-wrapper {
  background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');
  width: 32px; /* Adjust the width as needed */
  height: 32px; /* Adjust the height as needed */
}

body[theme="dark"] .avatar-wrapper {
  filter: invert(0) hue-rotate(0deg);
}
```

This should prevent the avatar from being affected by the dark mode filter
while maintaining the original appearance.

{{ user_msg() }}

Can I put that \<div\> element inside the "content" string here?

.chatgpt-message::before,<br>
.user-message::before {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;content: "";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;display: inline-block;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 32px;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;height: 32px;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin-right: 1rem;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-size: cover;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;vertical-align: top;<br>
}

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Unfortunately, you cannot directly include HTML elements inside the
**\`content\`** property of a pseudo-element in CSS.

Instead, you can create a separate div element for each avatar and include it
within the **\`.chatgpt-message\`** and **\`.user-message\`** elements, like
so:

```html
<div class="chatgpt-message">
  <div class="avatar-wrapper chatgpt-avatar"></div>
  <!-- Rest of the message content -->
</div>

<div class="user-message">
  <div class="avatar-wrapper user-avatar"></div>
  <!-- Rest of the message content -->
</div>
```

Then, update your CSS to apply the background image to the
**\`.avatar-wrapper\`** elements, and add the filter to cancel the dark mode
effect:

```css
.chatgpt-avatar {
  background-image: url('/images/chatgpt_avatar.webp');
}

.user-avatar {
  background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');
}

.avatar-wrapper {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 32px;
  height: 32px;
  margin-right: 1rem;
  background-size: cover;
  vertical-align: top;
}

body[theme="dark"] .avatar-wrapper {
  filter: invert(0) hue-rotate(0deg);
}
```

This approach allows you to maintain the original appearance of the avatars and
prevents them from being affected by the dark mode filter.

{{ user_msg() }}

Still not working.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

I apologize for the confusion. In this case, let's try a different approach.
You can use the **\`mix-blend-mode\`** CSS property to counteract the dark mode
effect on the avatars.

Here's the modified CSS:

```css
.chatgpt-message::before,
.user-message::before {
  content: "";
  display: inline-block;
  width: 32px;
  height: 32px;
  margin-right: 1rem;
  background-size: cover;
  vertical-align: top;
  mix-blend-mode: difference;
}

.chatgpt-message::before {
  background-image: url('/images/chatgpt_avatar.webp');
}

.user-message::before {
  background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');
}

body[theme="dark"] .chatgpt-message::before,
body[theme="dark"] .user-message::before {
  mix-blend-mode: normal;
}
```

This CSS code utilizes the **\`mix-blend-mode\`** property to counteract the
effect of the dark mode filter on the avatars. When the dark mode is enabled,
the **\`mix-blend-mode\`** is set back to **\`normal\`**, so the avatars should
display correctly.

{{ user_msg() }}

That mix-blend-mode seems to be inverting the image in the normal mode.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

I apologize for the confusion. Since the **\`mix-blend-mode\`** property did
not work as expected, let's revert to our previous strategy using the
**\`\<div\>\`** element for the avatar images. We will wrap the avatar in a
**\`\<div\>\`** and apply the **\`filter: invert(0) hue-rotate(0deg)\`** style
to the parent **\`\<div\>\`** in the dark mode.

Here's the modified HTML:

```html
<div class="chatgpt-message">
  <div class="avatar-wrapper">
    <div class="chatgpt-avatar"></div>
  </div>
  <p>Hello, how can I help you?</p>
</div>

<div class="user-message">
  <div class="avatar-wrapper">
    <div class="user-avatar"></div>
  </div>
  <p>What is the weather like today?</p>
</div>
```

And the CSS:

```css
.avatar-wrapper {
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: top;
}

.chatgpt-avatar,
.user-avatar {
  width: 32px;
  height: 32px;
  margin-right: 1rem;
  background-size: cover;
}

.chatgpt-avatar {
  background-image: url('/images/chatgpt_avatar.webp');
}

.user-avatar {
  background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');
}

body[theme="dark"] .avatar-wrapper {
  filter: invert(0) hue-rotate(0deg);
}
```

This should work correctly in both normal and dark modes, without affecting the
appearance of the avatar images.

{{ user_msg() }}

Any thoughts about this Stack Overflow page?

_\[Here I copied and pasted the content of the [Stack Overflow
page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71449836/css-important-not-important-enough-images-colors-stay-inverted).\]_

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

The Stack Overflow page you've shared is discussing a similar issue, where the
author is trying to invert the colors of a webpage for a dark theme, while
keeping the images unchanged. The accepted answer suggests inverting the images
twice, which effectively cancels out the inversion.

However, in your case, we have already taken a different approach by wrapping
the avatar images in a **\`\<div\>\`** element and applying the filter to the
parent **\`\<div\>\`** in dark mode. This should work correctly without the
need for inverting the images twice.

The key takeaway from the Stack Overflow discussion is that inverting colors
may not be the best approach for implementing a dark mode, as it could lead to
unpredictable results. Instead, it's generally better to define specific styles
for light and dark modes, giving you more control over the appearance of
elements in both modes.

{{ user_msg() }}

Here's another:

_\[Here I copied and pasted the content of [another Stack Overflow
page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71284310/how-to-prevent-dark-mode-inverting-background-images)
that I found.\]_

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

The solution provided in this Stack Overflow post suggests using a
**\`::after\`** pseudo-element to apply the background image and then inverting
it by the same amount as the main element. This way, the image will appear in
its original form. Here's how you can adapt this solution for your case:

1. Apply the **\`::after\`** pseudo-element to the **\`.user-message\`** class.

2. Add the **\`filter: invert(1)\`** to the **\`body[theme="dark"]
   .user-message::after\`** selector.

Here's the updated code:

```css
.user-message {
  position: relative;
}

.user-message::after {
  content: "";
  display: inline-block;
  width: 32px;
  height: 32px;
  margin-right: 1rem;
  background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');
  background-size: cover;
  vertical-align: top;
}

body[theme="dark"] .user-message::after {
  filter: invert(1);
}
```

This code snippet creates an **\`::after\`** pseudo-element for
**\`.user-message\`** to display the avatar image. It applies a **\`filter:
invert(1)\`** only when the theme is set to "dark", so the image will appear in
its original form.

{{ user_msg() }}

Here's a thread elsewhere:

_\[Here I copied and pasted the content of [yet another
thread](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/exclude-images-from-darkmode/page/2/)
that I found which appeared relevant.\]_

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Based on the thread you provided, it seems like users are having trouble
excluding images from being affected by the dark mode in their websites. A
common solution mentioned in the thread is to add the "darkmode-ignore" class
to the images or their container elements. Additionally, you can try increasing
the z-index value for the images.

Here's a code snippet that you can add to the Additional CSS section in the
WordPress customizer to increase the z-index value for all images:

```css
img { 
  z-index: 1001;
}
```

Keep in mind that the solutions provided in the thread might not work for
everyone, as the implementation of dark mode could vary depending on the theme,
page builder, and other factors.

If you're still having issues with images being affected by dark mode, you
might need to explore custom solutions based on your website's specific setup.

{{ user_msg() }}

Give me the best solution for this issue that you can, and explain how and why
it should work.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

The best solution to exclude images from being affected by the dark mode on
your website would be to combine the use of the "darkmode-ignore" class and
adjusting the z-index property for images. Here's why this approach should
work:

1. "darkmode-ignore" class: When the dark mode plugin processes the page, it
   looks for elements with the "darkmode-ignore" class and avoids applying dark
mode styles to those elements. By adding this class to your images or their
container elements, you're explicitly telling the plugin to ignore these images
when applying the dark mode styles.

2. Adjusting the z-index property: The z-index property determines the stacking
   order of elements on a web page. Elements with a higher z-index value are
placed in front of elements with lower z-index values. By setting the z-index
of the images higher than the dark mode layer, you ensure that the images will
be displayed above the dark mode layer, and the original image colors will be
preserved.

Here's how you can implement this solution:

Step 1: Add the "darkmode-ignore" class to images<br>
In your HTML code, add the "darkmode-ignore" class to the images or their
container elements. For example:

```html
<img src="your-image-source.jpg" alt="Your Image Description" class="darkmode-ignore">
```

Step 2: Increase the z-index value for images<br>
Add the following CSS code snippet to the Additional CSS section in the
WordPress customizer or in your theme's stylesheet (style.css file):

```css
img.darkmode-ignore { 
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1001;
}
```

This code will target all images with the "darkmode-ignore" class, setting
their position property to "relative" (so that the z-index property can be
applied) and increasing their z-index value to 1001.

By combining these two approaches, you should be able to exclude images from
being affected by the dark mode on your website. Remember that the exact
implementation and results might vary depending on your theme, page builder,
and other factors, so you might need to adjust the solution to better suit your
specific setup.

The SASS compiled into CSS for the DeepThought theme is all run together like this: "@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Jost:ital,wght@0,100;0,200;0,300;0,400;0,500;0,600;0,700;0,800;0,900;1,100;1,200;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,600;1,700;1,800;1,900&display=swap");html{scroll-behavior:smooth}body{font-family:"Jost",sans-serif;display:flex;flex-direction:column;min-height:100vh}body[theme=dark]{filter:invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)}section{flex:1}img[theme=dark],picture[theme=dark],video[theme=dark],pre[theme=dark]{filter:invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)}.pagination-previous,[...]"  What's the best way to format this readably?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

To make the SASS compiled CSS for the DeepThought theme more readable, you can
use a CSS formatter or beautifier. These tools can automatically format the CSS
code by adding proper indentation, line breaks, and spacing, making it more
human-readable.

Here's the formatted version of your provided CSS code:

```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Jost:ital,wght@0,100;0,200;0,300;0,400;0,500;0,600;0,700;0,800;0,900;1,100;1,200;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,600;1,700;1,800;1,900&display=swap");

html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;

  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

body[theme="dark"] {
  filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);
}

section {
  flex: 1;
}

img[theme="dark"],
picture[theme="dark"],
video[theme="dark"],
pre[theme="dark"] {
  filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);
}

.pagination-previous,

```

You can use online tools like [<u>CSS
Beautifier</u>](https://www.freeformatter.com/css-beautifier.html) or [<u>CSS
Formatter</u>](https://www.cleancss.com/css-beautify/) to format your CSS code.
Simply copy and paste your CSS code into these tools, and they will provide you
with a formatted version.

{{ user_msg() }}

Can I do it with a vim command?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Yes, you can format your CSS in Vim using a command. To do this, you can use
the **\`!\`** command in combination with an external command-line tool. The
**\`!\`** command allows you to filter your text through an external program.

For example, you can use the **\`css-beautify\`** tool from the
**\`js-beautify\`** package. First, you need to install it globally using
**\`npm\`**:

```
npm install -g js-beautify
```

After installing the package, open your CSS file in Vim and execute the
following command:

```
:%!css-beautify -t -s 2
```

This command does the following:

* **\`%\`** represents the entire file.

* **\`!\`** tells Vim to filter the selected range through the external command that follows.

* **\`css-beautify\`** is the external command.

* **\`-t\`** flag tells **\`css-beautify\`** to use tabs for indentation.

* **\`-s 2\`** specifies the number of spaces per indentation level (use either **\`-t\`** or **\`-s 2\`**, not both).

This will format your CSS code with the specified indentation settings.

Keep in mind that this requires an active internet connection and **\`npm\`**
installed on your system.

{{ user_msg() }}

Can I do it natively in vim with its builtin CSS indentation rules, without running an external program?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Yes, you can do it natively in Vim using its built-in indentation and
formatting rules for CSS. Here's a step-by-step process to format your CSS code
in Vim:

1. First, open your CSS file in Vim.

2. Type the following command to enable filetype plugins:

```
:filetype plugin on
```

Next, set the file type to **\`css\`** by typing:

```
:set filetype=css
```

Set the indentation settings for CSS. Type the following commands:

```
:set expandtab
:set tabstop=2
:set shiftwidth=2
:set softtabstop=2
```

These commands configure Vim to use spaces instead of tabs and set the
indentation width to 2 spaces.

Now, format your CSS code using the following command:

```
:gg=G
```

This command does the following:

* **\`gg\`** moves the cursor to the first line of the file.

* **\`=\`** applies indentation based on the current settings.

* **\`G\`** selects the range from the current line (the first line) to the
  last line.

Your CSS code should now be formatted according to Vim's built-in indentation
rules for CSS. Note that this method only adjusts the indentation, but doesn't
beautify the CSS code in the same way as external tools like
**\`css-beautify\`**.

{{ user_msg() }}

"gg=G" is not a command-line command.  =G in normal mode would work if the code
were on multiple lines, but it's all on a single line so it doesn't work.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Apologies for the confusion. You're right, the method I previously mentioned is
only useful when the CSS code is already split into multiple lines. To format
the minified CSS in Vim without using an external program, you can use a
combination of substitution and normal mode commands. Follow these steps:

1. Open your CSS file in Vim.

2. Type the following command to insert line breaks after specific characters:

```
:%s/;\|}/&\r/g
```

This command searches for semicolons (**\`;\`**) and closing curly braces
(**\`}\`**) and inserts a line break (**\`\r\`**) after each occurrence.

1. Next, set the file type to **\`css\`** by typing:

```
:set filetype=css
```

1. Set the indentation settings for CSS. Type the following commands:

```
:set expandtab
:set tabstop=2
:set shiftwidth=2
:set softtabstop=2
```

These commands configure Vim to use spaces instead of tabs and set the
indentation width to 2 spaces.

1. Now, format your CSS code using the following normal mode command:

```
:gg=G
```

This command adjusts the indentation based on the current settings.

With this approach, the CSS code should be split into multiple lines and
properly indented. Note that this method may not be as comprehensive as using
an external tool like **\`css-beautify\`**, but it should provide a more
readable format for your CSS code.

{{ user_msg() }}

I like "%s/[;}]/&\r/g" better.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

You're right. The regular expression **\`%s/[;}]/&\r/g\`** is a simpler and
more efficient way to achieve the same result. It will match either a semicolon
(**\`;\`**) or a closing curly brace (**\`}\`**) and insert a line break
(**\`\r\`**) after each occurrence.

Here are the updated steps:

1.  Open your CSS file in Vim.

2. Type the following command to insert line breaks after specific characters:

```
:%s/[;}]/&\r/g
```

1. Next, set the file type to **\`css\`** by typing:

```
:set filetype=css
```

1. Set the indentation settings for CSS. Type the following commands:

```
:set expandtab
:set tabstop=2
:set shiftwidth=2
:set softtabstop=2
```

1. Now, format your CSS code using the following normal mode command:

```
:gg=G
```

With this approach, the CSS code should be split into multiple lines and
properly indented.

{{ last_msg() }}

I should note that ChatGPT's instructions still contain an error.  The command
in normal mode should be <code>gg=G</code>, not <code>:gg=G</code>.  The colon
would start a command in command mode, and the <code>gg</code> and

If I use an external program, what are the best open source CSS beautifier
programs for Linux?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

There are several open-source CSS beautifiers available for Linux. Here are
three popular ones:

<span>1.</span> Prettier (**<u>https://prettier.io/</u>**): Prettier is a
widely-used code formatter that supports various programming languages,
including CSS, SCSS, and Less. It is easy to integrate with most text editors
and IDEs, and has a comprehensive set of options to control the formatting.

To install Prettier globally via npm, run:

```
npm install --global prettier
```

To format a CSS file using Prettier, run:

```
prettier --write <input-file.css>
```

<span>1.</span> css-beautify
(**<u>https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify</u>**): css-beautify is part
of the js-beautify project, which provides beautification for CSS, HTML, and
JavaScript files. It is available as a command-line tool as well as a library
for use in other programs.

To install css-beautify globally via npm, run:

```
npm install --global js-beautify
```

To format a CSS file using css-beautify, run:

```
css-beautify -o <output-file.css> <input-file.css>
```

<span>1.</span> stylelint (**<u>https://stylelint.io/</u>**): stylelint is a
modern CSS linter and fixer that helps you avoid errors and enforce consistent
conventions in your styles. It can also auto-format your CSS code using its
**\`--fix\`** option.

To install stylelint globally via npm, run:

```
npm install --global stylelint
```

To configure stylelint, create a **\`.stylelintrc.json\`** file in your project directory with the following content:

```json
{
  "extends": "stylelint-config-recommended",
  "rules": {}
}
```

To format a CSS file using stylelint, run:

```
stylelint <input-file.css> --fix
```

These tools should help you format your CSS code consistently and maintain a
readable codebase. Choose the one that best fits your workflow and project
requirements.

{{ user_msg() }}

Are there any written in Rust and Perl?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Yes, there are CSS beautifiers written in Rust and Perl as well. Here are
examples for each:

<span>1.</span> Rust: **\`rust-css-minifier\`**
(**<u>https://github.com/robmikh/rust-css-minifier</u>**) - Although primarily
a CSS minifier, it can also format CSS to be more readable.

To install **\`rust-css-minifier\`**, you need to have Rust and Cargo installed
on your system. Then run:

```
cargo install css-minifier
```

To format a CSS file using **\`rust-css-minifier\`**, run:

```
css-minifier --pretty <input-file.css> -o <output-file.css>
```

Note that this tool is more focused on minification, and the beautification
support might not be as comprehensive as other dedicated CSS beautifiers.

<span>1.</span> Perl: **\`CSS::Prettify\`**
(**<u>https://metacpan.org/pod/CSS::Prettify</u>**) - This Perl module is a CSS
formatter that can be used as a command-line tool or integrated into a Perl
script.

To install **\`CSS::Prettify\`**, use the **\`cpanm\`** command:

```
cpanm CSS::Prettify
```

Once installed, you can use the **\`css-prettify\`** command-line tool to
format a CSS file:

```
css-prettify -i <input-file.css> -o <output-file.css>
```

Keep in mind that the popularity and community support for these tools may not
be as extensive as those for the previously mentioned options, but they can
still be useful if you prefer working with Rust or Perl.

{{ last_msg() }}

Okay, back to the original detour!

{{ first_msg() }}

So it looks like the "img" CSS rule in the DeepThought theme is trying to avoid
the problem I'm encountering...

body[theme="dark"] {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);<br>
}<br>
section {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;flex: 1;<br>
}<br>
img[theme="dark"],<br>
picture[theme="dark"],<br>
video[theme="dark"],<br>
pre[theme="dark"] {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);<br>
}

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Yes, it seems the DeepThought theme is designed to handle the dark mode by
applying the **\`filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);\`** CSS rule to various
elements when the **\`theme\`** attribute is set to "dark". This creates the
appearance of a dark theme by inverting the colors and rotating the hue.

The following rules are applied when the theme is set to "dark":

1. For the body element: All the content within the **\`body\`** will be
   inverted and have the hue rotated by 180 degrees.

2. For **\`img\`**, **\`picture\`**, **\`video\`**, and **\`pre\`** elements
   with a **\`theme="dark"\`** attribute: These elements will have their colors
inverted and hue rotated by 180 degrees. This is done to maintain the original
appearance of these elements in dark mode, as their colors would otherwise be
doubly inverted (once by the **\`body\`** rule and once by their own rule).

This approach helps to create a dark mode experience without requiring
significant additional CSS or adjustments to the HTML structure.

{{ last_msg() }}

I'm not sure why ChatGPT says "as their colors would **otherwise** be doubly
inverted" above.  It seems clear that those elements **are** being doubly
inverted to cancel out the inversion from the **\`body\`** rule.

{{ first_msg() }}

So is it failing to work here because of using background-image()?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Yes, that's correct. The reason the dark mode isn't working as expected for the
element with a **\`background-image()\`** is because the CSS rules in the
DeepThought theme target only certain elements like **\`img\`**,
**\`picture\`**, **\`video\`**, and **\`pre\`** with a **\`theme="dark"\`**
attribute. The **\`filter\`** property applied to these elements doesn't affect
the **\`background-image()\`** of other elements.

To fix this issue, you can create a new CSS rule targeting the specific element
with the background image and apply the same **\`filter\`** property when the
**\`theme\`** attribute is set to "dark". Assuming the element with the
background image has a class name of **\`background-element\`**, you can add
the following CSS rule:

```css
body[theme="dark"] .background-element {
  filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);
}
```

This rule will apply the desired color inversion and hue rotation effect to the
**\`background-image()\`** of the **\`.background-element\`** when the theme is
set to "dark".

{{ user_msg() }}

How can I set the CSS class on the background image here?

.user-message::before {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');<br>
}

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

You cannot directly set a CSS class on a background image, but you can set a
class on the element that has the **\`::before\`** pseudo-element. Here's an
example of how you can apply the dark mode effect to the background image using
a class:

<span>1.</span> Add a class (e.g., **\`dark-bg-image**\`) to the element that
currently has the **\`user-message\`** class:

```html
<div class="user-message dark-bg-image">Your message here</div>
```

<span>1.</span> Modify the CSS rule for the dark mode to target the
**\`::before\`** pseudo-element of the element with the **\`dark-bg-image\`**
class:

```css
body[theme="dark"] .dark-bg-image::before {
  filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);
}
```

<span>1.</span> Finally, update your existing CSS rule to use the new
**\`dark-bg-image\`** class:

```css
.dark-bg-image::before {
  background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');
  /* other styles for the ::before pseudo-element */
}
```

With these changes, the dark mode effect will be applied to the
**\`background-image\`** of the **\`::before\`** pseudo-element when the
**\`theme\`** attribute is set to "dark".

{{ user_msg() }}

I think that what I want is two new Zola shortcodes that I could use like this
in the Markdown file:

{% user_msg %}<br>
My question?<br>
{% end %}

{% chatgpt_msg %}<br>
First message from ChatGPT<br>
...<br>
multiline of course<br>
{% end %}

{% user_msg %}<br>
My response.<br>
{% end %}

{% chatgpt_msg %}<br>
Second response from ChatGPT, etc.<br>
{% end %}

The shortcodes should then implement whatever is needed: \<div\> and
\<blockquote\> tags, WEBP and SVG avatars, etc.  How should I implement this?

Bear in mind the Zola Shortcodes documentation (repeated below):

_\[Here I copied and pasted the content of the [Zola
shortcodes](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/shortcodes)
documentation page again.\]_

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

To create shortcodes for user_msg and chatgpt_msg, you can follow the steps
below:

1. In your Zola project, navigate to the **\`templates/shortcodes\`**
   directory.  If it does not exist, create it.

2. Create two new shortcode templates, **\`user_msg.html\`** and
   **\`chatgpt_msg.html\`**, inside the **\`templates/shortcodes\`** directory.

3. In **\`user_msg.html\`**, add the following code:

```html
<div class="user-message">
  <div class="user-avatar">
    <img src="/images/user_avatar.webp" alt="User Avatar">
  </div>
  <blockquote>
    {{ body }}
  </blockquote>
</div>
```

1. In **\`chatgpt_msg.html\`**, add the following code:

```html
<div class="chatgpt-message">
  <div class="chatgpt-avatar">
    <img src="/images/chatgpt_avatar.svg" alt="ChatGPT Avatar">
  </div>
  <blockquote>
    {{ body }}
  </blockquote>
</div>
```

1. Update your site's CSS to style the new classes, **\`user-message\`**,
   **\`user-avatar\`**, **\`chatgpt-message\`**, and **\`chatgpt-avatar\`**, as
needed.

2. Now, you can use the shortcodes in your Markdown files like this:

```markdown
{% user_msg %}
My question?
{% end %}

{% chatgpt_msg %}
First message from ChatGPT
...
multiline of course
{% end %}

{% user_msg %}
My response.
{% end %}

{% chatgpt_msg %}
Second response from ChatGPT, etc.
{% end %}
```

These shortcodes will generate the appropriate HTML structure and include the
avatars for both user messages and ChatGPT messages. Don't forget to include
the necessary CSS for styling the message blocks and avatars.

{{ last_msg() }}

At this point, I took a break from chatting with ChatGPT and just continued
researching and experimenting on my own until I came up with a solution that I
was happy with:

{{ first_msg() }}

Here's the solution that I finally settled on.  First I made several shortcode
templates, starting with "templates/shortcodes/first_msg.html":

\<div class="chatgpt-conversation"\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;\<div class="message-block user-message"\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\<div class="avatar"\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\<img src="/images/deven_avatar.jpg" alt="Deven T. Corzine"\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</div\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\<div class="message-content"\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\<blockquote\>

Next is "templates/shortcodes/chatgpt_msg.html":

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</blockquote\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</div\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;\</div\><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;\<div class="message-block chatgpt-message"\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\<div class="avatar"\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\<img src="/images/chatgpt_avatar.svg" alt="ChatGPT Avatar"\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</div\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\<div class="message-content"\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\<blockquote\>

Next is "templates/shortcodes/user_msg.html":

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</blockquote\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;\</div\><br>
\</div\><br>
<br>
\<div class="message-block user-message"\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;\<div class="avatar"\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\<img src="/images/deven_avatar.webp" alt="Deven T. Corzine"\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;\</div\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;\<div class="message-content"\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\<blockquote\>

Finally I have "templates/shortcodes/last_msg.html":

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</blockquote\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</div\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;\</div\><br>
\</div\>

You'll notice that the HTML tags in each template are unbalanced.  This is
intentional, because it allows me to render a ChatGPT conversation like this in
the Markdown content file:

{\{ first_msg() }}<br>
Text of the first message sent from me to ChatGPT goes here.<br>
{\{ chatgpt_msg() }}<br>
ChatGPT's reply to my first message goes here.<br>
{\{ user_msg() }}<br>
Text of the second message sent from me to ChatGPT goes here.<br>
{\{ chatgpt_msg() }}<br>
ChatGPT's reply to my second message goes here.<br>
{\{ user_msg() }}<br>
Text of the third message sent from me to ChatGPT goes here.<br>
{\{ chatgpt_msg() }}<br>
ChatGPT's reply to my third message goes here.<br>
{\{ last_msg() }}

This allows me to very quickly and easily render an entire ChatGPT conversation
with many back-and-forth exchanges with minimal markup coding in the content
file.

I moved the ChatGPT avatar SVG code into a standalone
"static/images/chatgpt_avatar.svg" file, displayed by the \<img\> tag in the
"chatgpt_msg" shortcode template.  Why didn't you suggest this option when we
were trying to figure out the SVG?

Finally, I have the following CSS rules for styling the conversation:

.chatgpt-conversation {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: transparent;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;border: 1px solid #d4d4d4;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin: 1.5rem;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 0px;<br>
}

.message-block {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;display: flex;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;align-items: top;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 1rem;<br>
}

.avatar {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;flex: 0 0 auto;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 32px;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;height: 32px;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin-right: 1.5rem;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;vertical-align: top;<br>
}

.avatar img {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;border-radius: 2px;<br>
}

.message-content {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;flex: 1 1 auto;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;vertical-align: top;<br>
}

.message-content blockquote {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin: 0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 1em;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;border: none;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: transparent;<br>
}

.chatgpt-message {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: #f7f7f7;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;border-top: 1px solid #d4d4d4;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;border-bottom: 1px solid #d4d4d4;<br>
}

body[theme=dark] .chatgpt-message {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: #eaeaea;<br>
}

The result isn't precisely the same as the chat.openai.com website, but it's
similar and looks good.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Your solution is a creative approach to implementing a ChatGPT conversation
using Zola shortcodes. By breaking the conversation into different shortcode
templates, you can easily add and remove messages in the conversation while
keeping your Markdown content clean and minimal.

As for the SVG avatar, I apologize for not suggesting that option earlier.
Moving the SVG code into a standalone file and displaying it using the
**\`\<img\>\`** tag is a good approach, as it makes the code more modular and
reusable.

Your CSS rules seem to be tailored to your specific design needs, and if the
result is visually appealing and similar to the chat.openai.com website, then
it's a successful implementation.

Overall, your solution is well thought out, and it provides a flexible way to
render ChatGPT conversations within your Zola project.

{{ last_msg() }}

This is the end of the quest to find a way to nicely format ChatGPT
conversations, so it's a good stopping place.  I did encounter some issues with
Markdown formatting inside HTML tags; I'll cover that topic in my next post.
