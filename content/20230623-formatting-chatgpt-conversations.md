Oops!  It's been over a month since [my last
post](/2023/05/13/fine-tuning-the-website-theme/) about fine-tuning the website
theme.  I've been expecting this from the start, that sooner or later I'd fall
behind on making new blog posts because of being busy and distracted by
everyday life.  Oh well.  (I'll try not to fall so far behind again, but I'm
sure it will happen again, probably sooner than later!)

I've also been procrastinating on this post because formatting these ChatGPT
conversations is a rather tedious process.  That procrastination contributed to
the long delay since my last post.  Actually, figuring out how to format
ChatGPT conversations is the topic of this post...

<!-- more -->

I wanted to be able to quote parts of my conversations with ChatGPT in these
blog posts, but I did want them to be nicely formatted.  This turned out to be
more challenging than expected.  I did eventually come up with an acceptable
solution to this issue, but it remains a slow, painstaking process to render
these ChatGPT conversations.  Surely there must be a better way?

Unfortunately, I can't just copy & paste the conversation from the ChatGPT web
page into these Markdown content files and get a decent result.  If I try to
copy & paste the raw HTML, the result looks terrible and the content file
becomes unmaintainable anyhow.  Instead, I have to paste the conversation as
plain text, losing all of the original formatting in the process.

After that, I have to compare the original ChatGPT web page side-by-side with
the rendered blog post and fix a myriad of formatting issues, adding the
structural code to show the conversation in a box with the avatar images,
inserting hyperlinks, adding bold highlighting and backquotes, recreating code
blocks, escaping various metacharacters as necessary, fixing edge cases, etc.

This isn't a perfect reproduction of the way the conversations are actually
rendered on the ChatGPT website, but by the time I'm done fixing all the
formatting issues, the end result is a pretty good approximation.  I haven't
tried to match the fonts and colors but the overall formatting is similar.

To illustrate this, here is a screen capture (without the sidebar) from the
[ChatGPT website](https://chat.openai.com/) showing the first part of the
conversation quoted below, as it was actually rendered:

<img src="/images/ChatGPT_example.png" alt="Example screen capture from ChatGPT
website for comparison." style="border: 1px solid black;">

Compare the screen capture above with the rendered conversation below, then
continue reading the conversation as I start in on the topic of how to do this
in the first place!

{{ first_msg() }}

If I'm posting about my conversations with you, what's the best way to copy &
paste parts of our conversation and format them nicely with Markdown?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

When copying and pasting parts of your conversations with me into a Markdown
file, you can use a combination of blockquotes and code blocks to format the
conversation nicely.

<p>1. Blockquotes: Use `>` at the beginning of each line to create a
blockquote.  This is useful for quoting text from our conversation.</p>

For example:

```
> User: What is the capital of France?
> Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.
```

This will render as:

<blockquote style="border-left-color: #8e8ea0; border-left-style: solid;
border-left-width: 1.45455px; padding-left: 16px; line-height: 1.1;
font-weight: 600;">
"User: What is the capital of France?<br>
Assistant: The capital of France is Paris."
</blockquote>

<p>1. Code blocks: Use triple backticks (```) to create a code block. This is
useful for preserving the original formatting of the conversation, including
line breaks.</p>

For example:

\<pre\><br>
\`\`\`<br>
User: What is the capital of France?<br>
Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.<br>
\`\`\`<br>
\</pre\>

This will render as:

```
User: What is the capital of France?
Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.
```

Choose the formatting style that best fits the context and style of your post.
You can also use other Markdown formatting options, like bold or italic text,
to emphasize parts of the conversation as needed.



{{ last_msg() }}

(Yes, ChatGPT numbered both "Blockquote" and "Code blocks" as "1."  Go figure.)

{{ first_msg() }}

How hard would it be to add the avatar images to each message block as shown on
chat.openai.com?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

To add avatar images to each message block, you'll need to modify your Zola
theme's CSS and HTML templates. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

<p>1.</p>

First, download or create the avatar images you want to use for the user and
the assistant. Save them in your theme's **\`static\`** directory, for example,
**\`static/user-avatar.png\`** and **\`static/assistant-avatar.png\`**.

<p>2.</p>

Next, modify your theme's CSS file to add styles for the message blocks and
avatar images. Add the following CSS classes in your theme's CSS file:

```css
.message-block {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-start;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.avatar {
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
  margin-right: 1rem;
}

.user-message .avatar {
  background-image: url('/user-avatar.png');
  background-size: cover;
}

.assistant-message .avatar {
  background-image: url('/assistant-avatar.png');
  background-size: cover;
}

.message-content {
  max-width: 80%;
}
```

<span>1.</span> In your Zola content Markdown file, wrap each message in a
**\`div\`** element with the appropriate classes. For example:

```html
<div class="message-block user-message">
  <div class="avatar"></div>
  <div class="message-content">
    <blockquote>
      User: What is the capital of France?
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="message-block assistant-message">
  <div class="avatar"></div>
  <div class="message-content">
    <blockquote>
      Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</div>
```

You can adjust the CSS properties to change the size of the avatar images, the
spacing between elements, or any other styling preferences you may have.

This is a simple example and can be further customized to fit your desired
design.

{{ user_msg() }}

Your avatar image is implemented as \<svg\>

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

If you want to use an SVG image for the avatar, you can directly include the
SVG code in your HTML template.

Here's an example of how to do it:

<span>1.</span> Modify your theme's CSS file to remove the background-image
properties from the **\`.user-message .avatar\`** and **\`.assistant-message
.avatar\`** classes:

```css
.user-message .avatar {
  /* Remove background-image property */
}

.assistant-message .avatar {
  /* Remove background-image property */
}
```

<span>1.</span> In your Zola content Markdown file, replace the **\`div\`**
element for the avatar with the SVG code. For example:

```html
<div class="message-block user-message">
  <div class="avatar">
    <!-- User avatar SVG code goes here -->
  </div>
  <div class="message-content">
    <blockquote>
      User: What is the capital of France?
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="message-block assistant-message">
  <div class="avatar">
    <!-- Assistant avatar SVG code goes here -->
  </div>
  <div class="message-content">
    <blockquote>
      Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</div>
```

You can find the SVG code for the avatars in the chat.openai.com page source or
create your own SVG images. Make sure to adjust the size and other properties
of the SVG elements to fit the design you have in mind.

{{ user_msg() }}

My avatar isn't SVG, of course.  It's a WEBP image.  Yours is SVG.  Can I put
the SVG code into an external HTML file and include it with a Zola directive?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Yes, you can put the SVG code into an external HTML file and include it using
the **\`include\`** directive in Zola. Here's how to do it:

<p>1.</p>

Create an **\`_includes\`** directory inside your theme's **\`templates\`**
directory if it doesn't already exist. The path should be something like
**\`themes/your-theme/templates/_includes/\`**.

<p>2.</p>

Create an HTML file with the SVG code for the avatar inside the
**\`_includes\`** directory. For example, name it **\`assistant_avatar.html\`**
and add the SVG code for the assistant avatar.

<p>3.</p>

In your Zola content Markdown file, use the **\`include\`** directive to
include the SVG code in the avatar **\`div\`**. For example:

```html
<div class="message-block user-message">
  <div class="avatar">
    <img src="path/to/your-avatar.webp" alt="User Avatar" />
  </div>
  <div class="message-content">
    <blockquote>
      User: What is the capital of France?
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="message-block assistant-message">
  <div class="avatar">
    {% include "assistant_avatar.html" %}
  </div>
  <div class="message-content">
    <blockquote>
      Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</div>
```

Make sure to replace **\`path/to/your-avatar.webp\`** with the actual path to
your WEBP avatar image.

By using the **\`include\`** directive, Zola will include the content of the
**\`assistant_avatar.html\`** file in the specified location when rendering the
template.

{{ user_msg() }}

Since the DeepThought theme comes from another repository, can I create
"includes" or "_includes" at the top level of my site's directory structure,
where the "content", "themes" and "templates" directories are?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Yes, you can create an **\`_includes\`** directory at the top level of your
site's directory structure, alongside the **\`content\`**, **\`themes\`**, and
**\`templates\`** directories. Zola will look for includes in both your site's
top-level **\`_includes\`** directory and the theme's **\`_includes\`**
directory.

To create an **\`_includes\`** directory at the top level of your site:

<p>1.</p>

In your site's root directory, create a new directory called **\`_includes\`**.

<p>2.</p>

Move the **\`assistant_avatar.html\`** file (or create a new one) inside the
newly created **\`_includes\`** directory.

<p>3.</p>

In your Zola content Markdown file, use the **\`include\`** directive to
include the SVG code in the avatar **\`div\`**:

```html
<div class="message-block user-message">
  <div class="avatar">
    <img src="path/to/your-avatar.webp" alt="User Avatar" />
  </div>
  <div class="message-content">
    <blockquote>
      User: What is the capital of France?
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="message-block assistant-message">
  <div class="avatar">
    {% include "assistant_avatar.html" %}
  </div>
  <div class="message-content">
    <blockquote>
      Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</div>
```

Zola will first look for the **\`assistant_avatar.html\`** file in your site's
top-level **\`_includes\`** directory and then in the theme's **\`_includes\`**
directory. If it finds the file in either location, it will include the content
of the file in the specified location when rendering the template.

{{ last_msg() }}

This all sounds good, but of course it didn't actually work.  ChatGPT can be
helpful and informative one moment, and lead you astray the next.  Beware!

{{ first_msg() }}

The {% include "assistant_avatar.html" %} is just being rendered as HTML text.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Apologies for the confusion. In Zola, to include an HTML file, you'll need to
use the **\`load_data\`** function and then output the loaded data as safe
HTML.

To do this, follow these steps:

<span>1.</span> In the content Markdown file, use the **\`load_data\`**
function to load the **\`assistant_avatar.html\`** file:

```
{% set assistant_avatar = load_data(path="_includes/assistant_avatar.html") %}
```

<span>1.</span> Use the **\`safe\`** filter to output the loaded data as safe
HTML in the avatar **\`div\`**:

```html
<div class="message-block user-message">
  <div class="avatar">
    <img src="path/to/your-avatar.webp" alt="User Avatar" />
  </div>
  <div class="message-content">
    <blockquote>
      User: What is the capital of France?
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="message-block assistant-message">
  <div class="avatar">
    {{ assistant_avatar | safe }}
  </div>
  <div class="message-content">
    <blockquote>
      Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</div>
```

With these changes, Zola should include the SVG code from the
**\`assistant_avatar.html\`** file in the rendered output, and you should see
the avatars as expected.

{{ user_msg() }}

Where in the file should I put the {% set ... %} directive?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

You should place the **\`{% set ... %}\`** directive at the beginning of your
content Markdown file, before the opening **\`+++\`**. This way, Zola will load
the data before processing the rest of the content. Here's an example:

```
{% set assistant_avatar = load_data(path="_includes/assistant_avatar.html") %}

In this post, I'll share a conversation I had with ChatGPT, OpenAI's language model.

<div class="message-block user-message">
  <div class="avatar">
    <img src="path/to/your-avatar.webp" alt="User Avatar" />
  </div>
  <div class="message-content">
    <blockquote>
      User: What is the capital of France?
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="message-block assistant-message">
  <div class="avatar">
    {{ assistant_avatar | safe }}
  </div>
  <div class="message-content">
    <blockquote>
      Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.
    </blockquote>
  </div>
</div>
```

This will ensure that the **\`assistant_avatar\`** variable is set and
available for use in the rest of the content.

{{ last_msg() }}

Of course, this didn't work either!  ChatGPT's hallucinations continue...

{{ first_msg() }}

Building site...<br>
Error: Failed to serve the site<br>
Error: Couldn't find front matter in
\`/home/deven/git/codereflections/content/20230419-whats-in-a-name.md\`. Did
you forget to add \`+++\` or \`---\`?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Apologies for the confusion. It seems that Zola does not support setting
variables outside of the front matter. You can try the following workaround:

<span>1.</span> Create a new file called **\`avatars.toml\`** in your
**\`content\`** directory:

```toml
assistant_avatar = """
<!-- Paste your SVG code here -->
"""
```

<span>1.</span> In your content file, load this data file and then use the
**\`assistant_avatar\`** variable:

```

title = "My Conversation with ChatGPT"
date = 2023-04-18
slug = "conversation-with-chatgpt"
[taxonomies]
categories = ["AI"]
tags = ["OpenAI", "ChatGPT"]
+++

{% set avatars = load_data(path="avatars.toml") %}
{% set assistant_avatar = avatars.assistant_avatar %}

In this post, I'll share a conversation I had with ChatGPT, OpenAI's language model.

<!-- Add your message blocks here, using assistant_avatar -->
```

This should allow you to load the SVG data without encountering issues with the
front matter.

{{ user_msg() }}

I didn't try the TOML file yet because I'm also seeing {{ chatgpt_avatar | safe
}} rendered as HTML text.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

My apologies for the confusion. Since the content is being rendered as HTML
text, it seems that the **\`safe\`** filter is not working as expected.

Please try this alternative approach:

<span>1.</span> Create a file called **\`avatar_macros.html\`** in your
**\`templates\`** directory:

```
{% macro render_assistant_avatar() %}
  <!-- Paste your SVG code here -->
{% endmacro %}

{% macro render_user_avatar() %}
  <img src="path/to/your/webp/image" alt="User avatar" />
{% endmacro %}
```

<span>1.</span> In your content file, import the macros and use them to render
the avatars:

```
jinja2

{% import "avatar_macros.html" as avatar_macros %}

In this post, I'll share a conversation I had with ChatGPT, OpenAI's language model.

<!-- Add your message blocks here, using avatar_macros.render_assistant_avatar() and avatar_macros.render_user_avatar() -->
```

With this approach, you won't need to use the **\`safe\`** filter. The macros
will be called directly in the content and should render the SVG and image
elements correctly.

{{ user_msg() }}

I just tried asking the GPT-3.5 default model, in a new conversation, "Using
Zola, how can I have my content Markdown file include a block of HTML from
another file?"  This was the response:

To include a block of HTML from another file in your Markdown content using
Zola, you can use Zola's built-in shortcodes feature.

Here's an example of how to use a shortcode to include HTML from another file:

Create a new file in your Zola project's templates/shortcodes directory, e.g.
include.html.<br>
In the include.html file, add the HTML code you want to include, wrapped in a
div or other appropriate container element.<br>
In your Markdown content file, add a shortcode to include the HTML code from
include.html. The shortcode syntax is {% shortcode_name "file_path" %}, where
shortcode_name is the name you want to give the shortcode (e.g. include_html),
and file_path is the path to the file containing the HTML code you want to
include, relative to the root of your Zola project.<br>
For example, let's say you have a file called header.html in your Zola
project's templates directory that contains the HTML code for your website's
header:

html<br>
Copy code<br>
\<div class="header"\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;\<h1\>My Website\</h1\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;\<nav\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\<ul\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\<li\>\<a href="/"\>Home\</a\>\</li\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\<li\>\<a href="/about"\>About\</a\>\</li\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\<li\>\<a href="/contact"\>Contact\</a\>\</li\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</ul\><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;\</nav\><br>
\</div\><br>
To include this header HTML in your Markdown content file, you could create a
shortcode like this:

Create a new file called header.html in the templates/shortcodes directory.<br>
In the header.html file, add the following code:<br>
html<br>
Copy code<br>
{% with file_path = "templates/header.html" %}<br>
{% include file_path %}<br>
{% endwith %}<br>
In your Markdown content file, add the shortcode {% include_html "header.html"
%} where you want to include the header HTML.<br>
When Zola processes your Markdown file, it will replace the shortcode with the
contents of header.html, so the resulting HTML output will include your header.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

It appears that the response you received describes using Zola's shortcodes
feature to include a block of HTML from another file.

To use this method, please follow these steps:

<p>1.</p>

Create a new directory named **\`shortcodes\`** inside your project's
**\`templates\`** directory.

<p>2.</p>

Create a new file called **\`include_html.html\`** inside the
**\`templates/shortcodes\`** directory, and add the following code:

```
{% with file_path = args.path %}
  {% include file_path %}
{% endwith %}
```

<span>1.</span> In your Markdown content file, add the shortcode **\`{%
include_html path="path/to/your/file.html" %}\`** where you want to include the
HTML. Replace **\`path/to/your/file.html\`** with the path to the HTML file you
want to include, relative to your Zola project's root.

For example, if you have an HTML file called **\`assistant_avatar.html\`** in
the **\`templates/includes\`** directory, you can include it in your Markdown
content file like this:

```
+++
title = "My Conversation with ChatGPT"
date = 2023-04-18

+++

In this post, I'll share a conversation I had with ChatGPT, OpenAI's language model.

{% include_html path="templates/includes/assistant_avatar.html" %}
```

When Zola processes your Markdown file, it will replace the shortcode with the
contents of the specified HTML file.

{{ last_msg() }}

At this point, I was getting pretty tired of ChatGPT leading me into dead ends
with this, so I took the time to read through Zola's "shortcodes" documentation
myself, and quickly found that ChatGPT's instructions were wrong yet again.

I decided to call the documentation to ChatGPT's attention to see whether or
not it would improve its answer.  I knew that ChatGPT wouldn't fetch the URL,
but the URL might have been included in its training data.  I figured that
identifying the relevant URL might direct ChatGPT in the right direction...

{{ first_msg() }}

Reference https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/shortcodes/ and tell me
if you need to change your recommendation.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Apologies for the confusion earlier. Based on the official Zola documentation,
my previous recommendation was incorrect. Here's the correct method for
including an HTML file using shortcodes:

<p>1.</p>

Create a new directory named **\`shortcodes\`** inside your project's
**\`templates\`** directory.

<p>2.</p>

Create a new file called **\`include_html.html\`** inside the
**\`templates/shortcodes\`** directory, and add the following code:

```
{% include args.file_path %}
```

<span>1.</span> In your Markdown content file, add the shortcode **\`{%
include_html file_path="path/to/your/file.html" %}\`** where you want to
include the HTML. Replace **\`path/to/your/file.html\`** with the path to the
HTML file you want to include, relative to your Zola project's root.

For example, if you have an HTML file called **\`assistant_avatar.html\`** in
the **\`templates/includes\`** directory, you can include it in your Markdown
content file like this:

```

{% include_html file_path="templates/includes/assistant_avatar.html" %}
```

When Zola processes your Markdown file, it will replace the shortcode with the
contents of the specified HTML file.

{{ user_msg() }}

In this case, shouldn't I just create a "chatgpt_avatar" shortcode with the SVG
code?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Yes, you can directly create a **\`chatgpt_avatar\`** shortcode with the SVG
code. Here's how you can do it:

<p>1.</p>

Create a new directory named **\`shortcodes\`** inside your project's
**\`templates\`** directory if it doesn't already exist.

<p>2.</p>

Create a new file called **\`chatgpt_avatar.html\`** inside the
**\`templates/shortcodes\`** directory, and add the SVG code for the ChatGPT
avatar:

```html
<!-- Paste the ChatGPT SVG code here -->
```

<span>1.</span> In your Markdown content file, add the shortcode **\`{%
chatgpt_avatar %}\`** where you want to include the ChatGPT avatar. For
example:

```

{% chatgpt_avatar %}
```

When Zola processes your Markdown file, it will replace the shortcode with the
contents of the **\`chatgpt_avatar.html\`** file, which contains the ChatGPT
avatar SVG code.

{{ last_msg() }}

Again, having read through the documentation, I knew ChatGPT's instructions
were still wrong, so I decided to provide the content of that documentation so
that it could respond more appropriately.

{{ first_msg() }}

Are you sure about that?  Here's the content of that Zola shortcodes
documentation:

_\[Here I copied and pasted the content of the documentation page.\]_

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

I apologize for the confusion. You're correct. Based on the Zola documentation,
we should create a shortcode using a different approach. Here's the updated
method:

<p>1.</p>

Create a new directory named **\`shortcodes\`** inside your project's
**\`templates\`** directory if it doesn't already exist.

<p>2.</p>

Create a new file called **\`chatgpt_avatar.html\`** inside the
**\`templates/shortcodes\`** directory, and add the SVG code for the ChatGPT
avatar:

```html
<!-- Paste the ChatGPT SVG code here -->
```

<span>1.</span> In your Markdown content file, add the shortcode **\`{{
chatgpt_avatar\() }}\`** where you want to include the ChatGPT avatar. For
example:

<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#6c7079;"><code><span style="color:#abb2bf;">+++
</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">title = "My Conversation with ChatGPT"
</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">date = 2023-04-18
</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">slug = "conversation-with-chatgpt"
</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">[taxonomies]
</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">categories = ["AI"]
</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">tags = ["OpenAI", "ChatGPT"]
</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">+++
</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">
</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">In this post, I'll share a conversation I had with ChatGPT, OpenAI's language model.
</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">
</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">{{ chatgpt_avatar<span></span>() }}
</span></code></pre>

When Zola processes your Markdown file, it will replace the shortcode with the
contents of the **\`chatgpt_avatar.html\`** file, which contains the ChatGPT
avatar SVG code.

{{ last_msg() }}

Finally!  I had to quote the documentation to ChatGPT, but at least this time
the instructions were actually valid.  (It was a hassle to format the above
ChatGPT response for this post because Zola was trying to expand the
"chatgpt_avatar" shortcode in the code block!  I had to work around the problem
using HTML directly.)

I decided to press ChatGPT a bit on why providing the content of the
documentation was necessary, although I didn't really expect much from this
question...

{{ first_msg() }}

That worked finally.  Why didn't you get the right answer the first time, or
when I specifically referenced the Zola documentation link, which was clearly
in your training data?  Why did I need to copy and paste the content of that
page instead?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience caused by my initial response.
As an AI language model, I strive to provide the most accurate and helpful
information based on the context of the conversation. However, I'm not perfect
and can sometimes misunderstand the context or provide less than optimal
solutions.

When you provided the Zola documentation link, I should have recognized the
proper solution based on your request. It's possible that I didn't fully
understand your context or intent, which led to the less accurate response.
When you pasted the content of the documentation, it provided more context and
information, which helped me understand better and provide the correct
solution.

Again, I apologize for the confusion, and I appreciate your patience in working
with me to find the correct solution.

{{ last_msg() }}

Okay, so I've got a way to insert the ChatGPT avatar SVG image using a Zola
shortcode.  Now I need to figure out the CSS details...

{{ first_msg() }}

Where should I put the new CSS rules?  Should that be in the "static/css"
directory?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Yes, the best place to put your new CSS rules would be in the
**\`static/css\`** directory. You can either create a new CSS file for your
custom styles or add the rules to an existing CSS file if one is provided by
the theme.

If you create a new CSS file, you'll also need to make sure it's included in
your site's templates. To do this, open the **\`base.html\`** file (or a
similar file, depending on your theme's structure) in the **\`templates\`**
directory of your theme, and add a link to your new CSS file within the
**\`\<head\>\`** section:

<pre data-lang="html" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#6c7079;" class="language-html "><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span style="color:#abb2bf;">&lt;</span><span style="color:#eb6772;">link </span><span style="color:#db9d63;">rel</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">=</span><span style="color:#9acc76;">"stylesheet" </span><span style="color:#db9d63;">href</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">=</span><span style="color:#9acc76;">"{{ get_url<span></span>(path='/css/your_new_css_file.css') }}"</span><span style="color:#abb2bf;">&gt;
</span></code></pre>

Replace **\`your_new_css_file.css\`** with the name of the CSS file you
created. This will ensure that your new CSS rules are applied to your site.

{{ user_msg() }}

Okay, I'll create "static/css/chatgpt.css" for this.  But what is the point of
using the get_url() instead of just using href="/css/chatgpt.css"?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

You're right that using a direct path like **\`href="/css/chatgpt.css"\`** can
work in many cases. However, using the **\`get_url()\`** function in Zola
provides some benefits:

<p>1.</p>

URL generation: Zola handles generating the correct URLs for you, taking into
account any changes to the base URL or the site structure. This can be
especially helpful when deploying your site to different environments, such as
staging or production, where the base URL might differ.

<p>2.</p>

URL normalization: **\`get_url()\`** normalizes the URLs, ensuring that they
are properly formatted and do not contain any issues that might cause broken
links or unexpected behavior.

<p>3.</p>

Future-proofing: By using **\`get_url()\`**, you ensure that your code remains
compatible with future changes to Zola or your site structure, as the function
will continue to generate correct URLs even if the internal handling changes.

In summary, using **\`get_url()\`** is a good practice because it helps
maintain the consistency and robustness of your site's URLs. It makes your code
more maintainable and future-proof.

{{ last_msg() }}

I had a typo in the word "defined" in my next question, but ChatGPT understood
without skipping a beat...

{{ first_msg() }}

The SVG code is defiend with width="41" and height="41".  How do I resize this
to 32x32?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

You can easily resize the SVG by updating the **\`width\`** and **\`height\`**
attributes in the SVG code. To change the dimensions to 32x32, modify the
attributes like this:

```html
<svg width="32" height="32" ...>
```

Keep in mind that if the aspect ratio of the original SVG is not 1:1, the image
might appear slightly distorted when resized to 32x32. In this case, the
original dimensions are 41x41, which is a 1:1 aspect ratio, so you shouldn't
have any issues resizing it to 32x32.

{{ user_msg() }}

Changing the width and height like that won't affect the coordinates in the SVG
code?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

You're correct. If the SVG contains absolute coordinates, changing the width
and height attributes might not scale the entire image as expected. In that
case, you can use the **\`viewBox\`** attribute to control the scaling
properly.

If your SVG doesn't already have a **\`viewBox\`** attribute, you can add it
like this:

```html
<svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 41 41" ...>
```

Here, the **\`viewBox\`** attribute is set to **\`0 0 41 41\`**, which means
that the original dimensions of the SVG are 41x41. By setting the width and
height attributes to 32, the SVG will be scaled down proportionally to fit
within a 32x32 box while maintaining its aspect ratio.

If your SVG already has a **\`viewBox\`** attribute, you can just update the
width and height attributes to 32x32, and the SVG should scale proportionally.

{{ user_msg() }}

Ah, it already had viewBox="0 0 41 41".  Good.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Great! Since the viewBox attribute is already set to "0 0 41 41", you can
simply change the width and height attributes to 32x32, and the SVG will scale
down proportionally while maintaining its aspect ratio.

Here's the updated SVG code:

```html
<svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 41 41" ...>
```

Now the SVG should display at the desired size of 32x32 pixels.

{{ user_msg() }}

That worked fine.  Here's one of the original CSS rules you gave me:

.assistant-message .avatar {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-image: url('/assistant-avatar.png');<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-size: cover;<br>
}

First, should this be using the Zola get_url() also?  Also, how do I change
this to use the SVG code?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Since the CSS file is a static asset and not processed by Zola, there's no need
to use **\`get_url()\`** in this case. You can continue to use the relative
path to the CSS file in the **\`href\`** attribute.

To change the CSS rule to use the SVG code, you can use an inline SVG as a
background image by encoding it as a data URI. Here's how to do it:

1. Remove the line **\`background-image: url('/assistant-avatar.png');\`** from
   your CSS rule.

2. Go to an SVG-to-data-URI converter tool, such as **[<u>this
   one</u>](https://yoksel.github.io/url-encoder/)**.

3. Paste your entire SVG code into the converter tool.

4. Copy the resulting data URI from the tool.

5. Add the data URI as the **\`background-image\`** in your CSS rule:

```css
.assistant-message .avatar {
  background-image: url('data:image/svg+xml;base64,...');
  background-size: cover;
}
```

Replace the **\`...\`** in the **\`url()\`** with the actual data URI you got
from the converter tool.

This way, the CSS rule will use the inline SVG code as the background image for
the **\`.assistant-message .avatar\`** class.

{{ user_msg() }}

Can I simplify this example by using CSS to insert the div for the avatars?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Yes, you can simplify the example by using the **\`::before\`** pseudo-element
in your CSS to insert the avatar without having to add an extra **\`div\`** in
your HTML. Here's how you can modify the CSS:

```css
.assistant-message::before,
.user-message::before {
  content: "";
  display: inline-block;
  width: 32px;
  height: 32px;
  margin-right: 8px;
  background-size: cover;
  vertical-align: middle;
}

.assistant-message::before {
  background-image: url('data:image/svg+xml;base64,...');
}
```

Replace the **\`...\`** in the **\`url()\`** with the actual data URI you got
from the converter tool.

Now you can remove the avatar **\`div\`** from your HTML:

```html
<div class="assistant-message">
  <p>Assistant: Hi, how can I help you today?</p>
</div>
```

With this approach, the avatar will be automatically inserted before each
message with the **\`.assistant-message\`** class, and you don't need to
include the extra **\`div\`** for the avatar in your HTML.

{{ user_msg() }}

What does "background-size: cover" mean?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

**\`background-size: cover\`** is a CSS property that controls the size of a
background image in an element. The **\`cover\`** value specifies that the
background image should be scaled proportionally to completely cover the
content area of the element. In other words, the image will be resized so that
it is at least as large as the element's width or height, whichever is greater.

This might result in the image being cropped if its aspect ratio doesn't match
the element's aspect ratio. The main goal of using **\`background-size:
cover\`** is to ensure that the background image always covers the entire
element, regardless of the element's size or the image's aspect ratio.

{{ user_msg() }}

I feel like I have more rules than I need here:

.message-block {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;display: flex;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;align-items: flex-start;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin-bottom: 1rem;<br>
}

.avatar {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 32px;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;height: 32px;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin-right: 1rem;<br>
}

.user-message .avatar {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-size: cover;<br>
}

.chatgpt-message .avatar {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-image: url('/chatgpt-avatar.png');<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-size: cover;<br>
}

.message-content {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;max-width: 80%;<br>
}

.chatgpt-message::before,<br>
.user-message::before {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;content: "";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;display: inline-block;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 32px;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;height: 32px;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin-right: 8px;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-size: cover;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;vertical-align: middle;<br>
}

.chatgpt-message::before {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-image: url('data:image/svg+xml;base64,...');<br>
}

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

It seems that you have some redundant styles. Here's a simplified version of your CSS:

```css
.message-block {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-start;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.avatar {
  width: 32px;
  height: 32px;
  margin-right: 1rem;
  background-size: cover;
}

.user-message .avatar {
  background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');
}

.chatgpt-message .avatar {
  background-image: url('data:image/svg+xml;base64,...');
}

.message-content {
  max-width: 80%;
}
```

In this simplified version, I removed the redundant styles for **\`::before\`**
pseudoelements and directly set the background-image for the
**\`.chatgpt-message .avatar\`** and **\`.user-message .avatar\`** classes. The
**\`background-size: cover;\`** style has been moved to the **\`.avatar\`**
class, as it is common to both avatars.

{{ user_msg() }}

How are the ::before elements redundant?  I thought the whole point of them was
not to need a second div in the content?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Apologies for the confusion. You are correct that the **\`::before\`**
pseudoelements can be used to avoid having a second div in the content. I
misunderstood your intention in the previous response. If you would like to use
the **\`::before\`** pseudoelements, you can update your CSS like this:

```css
.message-block {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-start;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.message-content {
  max-width: 80%;
}

.chatgpt-message::before,
.user-message::before {
  content: "";
  display: inline-block;
  width: 32px;
  height: 32px;
  margin-right: 8px;
  background-size: cover;
  vertical-align: middle;
}

.chatgpt-message::before {
  background-image: url('data:image/svg+xml;base64,...');
}

.user-message::before {
  background-image: url('/images/deven_avatar.webp');
}
```

With this CSS, you won't need the extra **\`.avatar\`** div in your content.
The avatars will be generated using the **\`::before\`** pseudoelements for
both **\`.chatgpt-message\`** and **\`.user-message\`** elements.

{{ user_msg() }}

Which is better for the "margin-right"?  "8px" or "1rem"?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Both "8px" and "1rem" can be used for the "margin-right," but they serve
slightly different purposes.

Using "8px" sets a fixed margin of 8 pixels between the elements, which will
remain the same regardless of the font size or zoom level.

Using "1rem," on the other hand, sets a margin relative to the root element's
font size. If the root font size is set to 16 pixels (which is the default for
most browsers), then "1rem" will be equivalent to 16 pixels. However, if the
user changes the font size or zooms in/out on the webpage, the margin will
adjust accordingly.

In general, using "1rem" is preferred in responsive designs because it allows
for better adaptability to different devices and user settings. If you want a
fixed margin that doesn't change with the font size, you can use "8px."

{{ user_msg() }}

Yes, the code should work. You've correctly included the SVG path using the
"data:image/svg+xml," followed by the path itself, in the "background-image"
property of the ".chatgpt-message::before" selector. Just make sure that the
SVG path doesn't have any line breaks or extra spaces in it, and it should
display the SVG as a background image correctly.

It's not working.  The WEBP background image for my avatar works, but the
ChatGPT SVG avatar is not visible.  Here's all the CSS rules I added:

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

It looks like the SVG code you provided has an issue that is causing it not to
be displayed correctly. The problem is that the SVG data URL in the CSS is not
URL-encoded, and some characters in the SVG data might cause issues when used
directly in CSS. Here's a quick solution for you:

Replace the SVG code in the **\`background-image\`** for
**\`.chatgpt-message::before\`** with the following URL-encoded SVG:

```css
.chatgpt-message::before {
  background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg width='40' height='41' viewBox='0 0 40 41' fill='none' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%3E%3Cpath d='M37.5324 16.8707C37.9808 15.5241 38.1363 14.0974 37.9886 12.6859C37.8409 11.2744 37.3934 9.91076 36.676 8.68622C35.6126 6.83404 33.9882 5.3676 32.0373 4.4985C30.0864 3.62941 27.9098 3.40259 25.8215 3.85078C24.8796 2.7893 23.7219 1.94125 22.4257 1.36341C21.1295 0.785575 19.7249 0.491269 18.3058 0.500197C16.1708 0.495044 14.0893 1.16803 12.3614 2.42214C10.6335 3.67624 9.34853 5.44666 8.6917 7.47815C7.30085 7.76286 5.98686 8.3414 4.8377 9.17505C3.68854 10.0087 2.73073 11.0782 2.02839 12.312C0.956464 14.1591 0.498905 16.2988 0.721698 18.4228C0.944492 20.5467 1.83612 22.5449 3.268 24.1293C2.81966 25.4759 2.66413 26.9026 2.81182 28.3141C2.95951 29.7256 3.40701 31.0892 4.12437 32.3138C5.18791 34.1659 6.8123 35.6322 8.76321 36.5013C10.7141 37.3704 12.8907 37.5973 14.9789 37.1492C15.9208 38.2107 17.0786 39.0587 18.3747 39.6366C19.6709 40.2144 21.0755 40.5087 22.4946 40.4998C24.6307 40.5054 26.7133 39.8321 28.4418 38.5772C30.1704 37.3223 31.4556 35.5506 32.1119 33.5179C33.5027

{{ user_msg() }}

Your response was truncated, but is the real problem that the data URI needs
the \<svg\> tags and not just the path string alone?  Don't quote the full path
again in your response; just show a placeholder instead.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Yes, you're correct. The problem is that the data URI for the SVG needs to
include the **\`\<svg\>\`** tags and not just the path string alone. You should
replace the path in the **\`background-image\`** property of the
**\`.chatgpt-message::before\`** selector with the complete SVG, which includes
the **\`\<svg\>\`** tags and its attributes.

Here's an example of how it should look like:

```css
.chatgpt-message::before {
  background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml, [your_complete_SVG_here]");
}
```

Replace **\`[your_complete_SVG_here]\`** with the complete SVG code including the \`**\<svg\>\`** tags, and it should work as expected.

{{ user_msg() }}

Okay, the background image is working now.  It had nothing to do with needing
to be URL-encoded, it was the missing \<svg\> tags, and then I had to change
the outer quotes to single quotes to nest the double quote in the string.
Here's what the working code looks like:

.chatgpt-message::before {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-image: url('data:image/svg+xml,\<svg width="32"
height="32" viewBox="0 0 41 41" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
stroke-width="1.5" class="h-6 w-6"\>\<path d="M37.5324 16.8707C37.9808 [...]
25.4983L16.071 22.9985V17.9991Z" fill="currentColor"\>\</path\>\</svg\>');<br>
}

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Great! I'm glad to hear that it's working now. You have correctly added the
missing **\`\<svg\>\`** tags and changed the outer quotes to single quotes.
Here's the working CSS code for reference:

```css
.chatgpt-message::before {
  background-image: url('data:image/svg+xml,<svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 41 41" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke-width="1.5" class="h-6 w-6"><path d="M37.5324 16.8707C37.9808 [...] 25.4983L16.071 22.9985V17.9991Z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg>');
}
```

Now the ChatGPT SVG avatar should be visible, and the CSS rules should work as
intended. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free
to ask.

Whew!  That was quite an ordeal, just to get a couple avatars working!  This
isn't the end of the quest to find a clean solution for formatting ChatGPT
conversations for these blog posts, but this post is quite long already, so
I'll return to the topic in a later post.

This is a good stopping point, since this the point at which I diverted the
conversation for a while to discuss a problem I had discovered for the dark
mode theme.  I'll continue with that issue in the next post...
