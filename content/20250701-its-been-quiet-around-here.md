Whoops!  Looks like I lost track of time entirely.  This time, it's been **a
year and a half** since [my last
post](/2023/12/24/bootstrapping-perl-without-a-compiler)! ðŸ˜±

<!-- more -->

I was a speaker again last year at [The Perl and Raku Conference
2024](https://tprc.us/tprc-2024-las/) in Las Vegas, Nevada.  The recording of
my [Direct Access to PDF internals with
PDF::Data](https://tprc2024.sched.com/event/1dGsq/direct-access-to-pdf-internals-with-pdfdata)
talk is [also on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzEWyELP5hI).

I didn't have a talk this past weekend at [The Perl and Raku Conference
2025](https://tprc.us/tprc-2025-gsp/) in Greenville, South Carolina.  Maybe
next year!

I have some ideas in mind for new blog posts to write, hopefully in the near
future.  For example, I just signed up for a free
[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) account and reconfigured
[CodeReflections.com](https://codereflections.com/) to be cached by Cloudflare
and backed by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), for a solid **free**
hosting solution for the blog itself! ðŸŽ‰

I'll aim to make that the topic of my next post...
