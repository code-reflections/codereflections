Well, it's been over a month again since [my last
post](/2023/06/24/trouble-with-dark-mode-theme).  July was a busy month again,
especially because I was a
[speaker](https://tprc2023.sched.com/event/1Lhnq/making-sense-of-regular-expressions)
at [The Perl and Raku Conference 2023](https://tprc.to/tprc-2023-tor/) in
Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  The recording of my [Making Sense of Regular
Expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUB4wZSsxm4) talk is on YouTube.
More on that later -- this post is about wrapping up the origin story of this
blog, although there's still a bit more to come...

<!-- more -->

To recap the story so far:

1. I decided on "CodeReflections" for the name of this blog, and registered the
   "codereflections.com" domain name: [What's in a
name?](/2023/04/19/whats-in-a-name/)

2. I explored some of the basics decisions I needed to consider, such as
   whether to use a dynamic site (like WordPress) or a static site generator
(like Jekyll), monetization options, various blogging platforms to consider,
possibly using GitHub Pages for free hosting, setting up a separate GitHub
account for the blog, HTML/CSS layout design, website theme options, options
for hosting comments for static sites, and privacy considerations: [How the
sausage is made.](/2023/04/20/how-the-sausage-is-made/)

3. I researched many hosting options and decided to get a cheap ($4/month)
   virtual private server (VPS) from BuyVM which I could use to host the site
(at least initially) and to host some sort of comment system, and which will be
capable of running Docker containers if I choose to: [Searching for a hosting
provider...](/2023/04/21/searching-for-a-hosting-provider/)

4. I researched the various blogging platform options in depth, and decided to
   try using the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) static site generator
(written in Rust) for the blog: [Choosing a blogging
platform.](/2023/04/22/choosing-a-blogging-platform/)

5. I researched several interesting privacy-oriented options for integrating
   comment support with a static site using local data storage (not decided yet
but leaning toward [Remark42](https://remark42.com/)), vented to ChatGPT about
the lack of simple client-side HTML include functionality, debated whether Git
repository bloat is a concern, and asked about AdBlock detection: [Choosing a
comment system.](/2023/04/23/choosing-a-comment-system/)

6. I explored many theme options for Zola and considered whether it might be
   worth porting any Jekyll themes to Zola, decided to imitate WordPress URLs,
discussed some of the mechanics of making blog posts with Zola, and ultimately
decided to start with Zola's DeepThought theme: [Choosing a website
theme.](/2023/05/05/choosing-a-website-theme/)

7. I decided to style the blog's name as "CodeReflections" instead of "Code
   Reflections", did some tuning/debugging on the DeepThought theme, debated
category/tag taxonomies, contemplated a separate personal blog, debated the
number of posts to display per page, explored how to implement "infinite
scrolling" for a static site, fixed the navigation bar to the top of the
screen, discussed "front matter" metadata, researched Vim syntax highlighting
for Markdown/TOML and Vim plugin managers, discussed an imaginary "vim-zola"
plugin that ChatGPT randomly hallicunated, searched Google and found a real
Neovim plugin for Zola which also works on Vim, discussed more details about
blog post "front matter" metadata and creating future posts: [Fine-tuning the
website theme.](/2023/05/13/fine-tuning-the-website-theme/)

8. I worked with ChatGPT to figure out how to render my ChatGPT conversations
   nicely in HTML for the blog posts, and resolved various issues with avatars:
[Formatting ChatGPT
conversations.](/2023/06/23/formatting-chatgpt-conversations/)

9. I explored a problem with the DeepThought theme's dark mode causing the
   colors of my avatar image to be inverted, detoured into a discussion about
pretty-printing CSS, and developed a solution for improving and simplifying the
rendering of ChatGPT conversations using Zola "shortcodes": [Trouble with dark
mode theme.](/2023/06/24/trouble-with-dark-mode-theme/)

I want to finish this origin story and move on to other topics, so I'm going to
quote less of the remaining ChatGPT conversation and summarize more.

I discussed linking between different blog posts using relative permalink path
URLs, my intention to avoid changing the permalink structure (to avoid breaking
old bookmarks and hurting SEO), and some issues with Markdown links not being
rendered.  This issue turned out to be caused by attempting to use Markdown
formatting inside an **\<ol\>** tag in the content file, which caused Zola to
skip Markdown processing inside that tag.

The initial workaround I found was to simply use Markdown to generate the
**\<ol\>** block instead, by prefixing each item with a number and a period.
This had some limitations, which I revisited later.

I discussed how code boxes inside formatted ChatGPT conversations were causing
the block quote to be too wide and overflow the box, and worked with ChatGPT to
figure out how to fix it and add a horizontal scrollbar in this situation.
This took a lot of back-and-forth discussion and experimentation because many
of the suggestions ChatGPT gave simply didn't work as hoped or predicted.

ChatGPT suggested a **dozen** different approaches to try to fix the CSS to
solve the problem, but every single one of them either did the wrong thing
(like wrapping the text) or just did nothing.  By the 12<sup>th</sup>
suggestion, ChatGPT was even starting to sound a bit frustrated...  ChatGPT
actually recommended that I seek assistance elsewhere!!

{{ first_msg() }}

I don't want to use the full width of the parent container.  I have margins on
the conversation box.  Here's my CSS right now:

.chatgpt-conversation {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: transparent;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;border: 1px solid #d4d4d4;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin: 1.5rem;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 0px;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;max-width: 100%;<br>
}<br>
<br>
.message-block {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;display: flex;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;align-items: top;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 1rem;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;max-width: 100%;<br>
}<br>
<br>
.avatar {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;flex: 0 0 auto;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 32px;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;height: 32px;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin-right: 1.5rem;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;vertical-align: top;<br>
}<br>
<br>
.avatar img {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;border-radius: 2px;<br>
}<br>
<br>
.message-content {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;flex: 1 1 auto;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;vertical-align: top;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;position: relative;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;max-width: 100%;<br>
}<br>
<br>
.message-content blockquote {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin: 0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 1em;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;border: none;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: transparent;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;max-width: 100%;<br>
}<br>
<br>
.message-content blockquote pre {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;overflow-x: auto;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;max-width: 100%;<br>
}<br>
<br>
.chatgpt-message {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: #f7f7f7;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;border-top: 1px solid #d4d4d4;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;border-bottom: 1px solid #d4d4d4;<br>
}<br>
<br>
body[theme=dark] .chatgpt-message {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: #eaeaea;<br>
}

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

I apologize for the confusion. In this case, you can try adding **\`box-sizing: border-box;\`** to the **\`.message-content\`** class:

```css
.message-content {
  flex: 1 1 auto;
  vertical-align: top;
  position: relative;
  max-width: 100%;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

This will ensure that the padding and border are included in the element's
total width, rather than added to it. This should help constrain the width of
the content within the conversation box. If this still doesn't work, there may
be other factors involved that are beyond the scope of this conversation. In
that case, I recommend seeking assistance from a web development expert or
community forum to help you troubleshoot the issue further.

{{ last_msg() }}

When this suggestion failed as well, ChatGPT just gave up outright!

{{ first_msg() }}

Again, that did nothing.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that we have exhausted the options I
can provide as an AI language model. I would recommend seeking assistance from
a web development expert or community forum to help you troubleshoot the issue
further. They will be able to work with you interactively and provide a more
hands-on approach to find the solution that works best for your specific case.

{{ last_msg() }}

Nope, I refuse to accept that answer.  It's time to try a different approach to
see if ChatGPT can actually help, despite this pessimistic response...

{{ first_msg() }}

Remember the shortcodes I have:

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Yes, I remember the shortcodes you provided. They are designed to create the
structure for your ChatGPT conversation, with unbalanced HTML tags that allow
you to render a conversation with minimal markup coding in the content file.

You have four shortcode templates:

1. **\`first_msg.html\`** - Represents the beginning of the conversation with
   the user message.

2. **\`chatgpt_msg.html\`** - Represents a ChatGPT message within the
   conversation.

3. **\`user_msg.html\`** - Represents a user message within the conversation.

4. **\`last_msg.html\`** - Represents the end of the conversation, closing the
   HTML structure.

These shortcodes help you to easily create a conversation between the user and
ChatGPT by including them in your Markdown content file.

{{ user_msg() }}

Now, explain to me step-by-step, one element at a time, what controls the width
of each element and why it should or shouldn't work as I need it to.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

I'll break down the CSS rules you provided and explain how they control the
width and layout of the conversation elements.

{{ ol_open() }}

{{ li() }} **\`.chatgpt-conversation\`**:

* **\`max-width: 100%;\`** ensures that the conversation container does not
  exceed the width of its parent container.

* **\`margin: 1.5rem;\`** applies a margin around the conversation container,
  separating it from other elements.

* **\`padding: 0px;\`** removes any padding from the conversation container.

{{ li() }} **\`.message-block\`**:

* **\`display: flex;\`** enables flexbox for the message block, allowing you to
  align and position the avatar and message content horizontally.

* **\`align-items: top;\`** aligns the avatar and message content to the top of
  the flex container.

* **\`padding: 1rem;\`** adds padding around the message block, separating it
  from the other messages.

* **\`max-width: 100%;\`** ensures the message block does not exceed the width
  of its parent container, which is the conversation container.

{{ li() }} **\`.avatar\`**:

* **\`flex: 0 0 auto;\`** sets the avatar's width and height to not grow or
  shrink, and to be determined by the auto value (based on the content).

* **\`width: 32px; height: 32px;\`** sets the width and height of the avatar.

* **\`margin-right: 1.5rem;\`** adds a right margin to separate the avatar from
  the message content.

{{ li() }} **\`.message-content\`**:

* **\`flex: 1 1 auto;\`** sets the message content to grow and shrink based on
  available space, occupying the remaining width in the flex container.

* **\`position: relative;\`** establishes a new stacking context for the
  message content.

* **\`max-width: 100%;\`** ensures the message content does not exceed the
  width of its parent container, which is the message block.

{{ li() }} **\`.message-content blockquote\`**:

* **\`max-width: 100%;\`** ensures the blockquote does not exceed the width of
  its parent container, which is the message content.

{{ li() }} **\`.message-content blockquote pre\`**:

* **\`overflow-x: auto;\`** allows the horizontal scrollbar to appear when the
  content of the **\`\<pre\>\`** element overflows its container.

* **\`max-width: 100%;\`** ensures the **\`\<pre\>\`** element does not exceed
  the width of its parent container, which is the blockquote.

{{ ol_close() }}

The current issue you're facing is that the **\`\<pre\>\`** element is
extending beyond the conversation container. The issue is caused by the fact
that flexbox does not automatically restrict the width of child elements based
on the parent container width.

To fix this issue, you can add **\`min-width: 0;\`** to the
**\`.message-content\`** class.  This will make sure the flex item's content
does not overflow its container.

```css
.message-content {
  flex: 1 1 auto;
  vertical-align: top;
  position: relative;
  max-width: 100%;
  min-width: 0; /* Add this property */
}
```

By applying this fix, the **\`\<pre\>\`** element should be restricted to the
width of the conversation container and display a horizontal scrollbar as
needed.

{{ user_msg() }}

Why would a min-width matter for the max-width?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

The **\`min-width\`** property matters in this context because of how flexbox
handles the width of child elements. When you set **\`flex: 1 1 auto;\`** on
the **\`.message-content\`** class, it tells the browser that the element
should grow and shrink based on the available space. However, flexbox will not
automatically limit the width of the child elements based on the parent
container width if the child's content is wider than the parent container.

By setting **\`min-width: 0;\`**, you are explicitly telling the browser that
the **\`.message-content\`** can have a width as small as 0, effectively
overriding its natural minimum width determined by the content. This allows the
flexbox to shrink the **\`.message-content\`** when needed, preventing it from
overflowing the conversation container.

As a result, the **\`max-width: 100%;\`** on the **\`.message-content
blockquote pre\`** class will now work correctly and prevent the
**\`\<pre\>\`** element from overflowing its container. The horizontal
scrollbar will appear as needed when the content of the **\`\<pre\>\`** element
overflows its container.

In summary, adding **\`min-width: 0;\`** to the **\`.message-content\`** class
helps the flexbox handle the width of its child elements correctly, ensuring
that the **\`max-width: 100%;\`** property on the **\`\<pre\>\`** element works
as intended.

{{ user_msg() }}

See, now THAT fixed the problem.  You were giving up too easily.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

I apologize for any confusion earlier, and I'm glad the solution worked for
you! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, please feel
free to ask. I'm here to help.

{{ user_msg() }}

That min-width was the key all along.  Adding just min-width to my original CSS
worked without the rest of the changes.  Here's what I have now, which is still
working:

.chatgpt-conversation {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: transparent;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;border: 1px solid #d4d4d4;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin: 1.5rem;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 0px;<br>
}<br>
<br>
.message-block {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;display: flex;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;align-items: top;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 1rem;<br>
}<br>
<br>
.avatar {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;flex: 0 0 auto;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 32px;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;height: 32px;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin-right: 1.5rem;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;vertical-align: top;<br>
}<br>
<br>
.avatar img {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;border-radius: 2px;<br>
}<br>
<br>
.message-content {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;flex: 1 1 auto;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;vertical-align: top;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;min-width: 0;<br>
}<br>
<br>
.message-content blockquote {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;margin: 0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 1em;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;border: none;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: transparent;<br>
}<br>
<br>
.chatgpt-message {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: #f7f7f7;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;border-top: 1px solid #d4d4d4;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;border-bottom: 1px solid #d4d4d4;<br>
}<br>
<br>
body[theme=dark] .chatgpt-message {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: #eaeaea;<br>
}

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Great! I'm glad that adding the **\`min-width: 0\`** to the
**\`.message-content\`** resolved the issue for you. Your final CSS looks clean
and well-organized. If you have any further questions or need assistance with
anything else, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help.

{{ last_msg() }}

Lo and behold, after a dozen failed attempts, ChatGPT got the answer right on
the first try this time!  This is a good technique to keep in mind when ChatGPT
is struggling to answer a question correctly.  Asking ChatGPT to explain things
in step-by-step detail can improve its reasoning and result in better answers.

With the width issue solved, the next issue related to indentation in numbered
lists...

{{ first_msg() }}

Hmm, in a numbered list that Markdown turns into \<ol\>, the paragraph with the
number gets indented, but the code block and additional paragraphs under the
same number aren't indented for the number entry.  How can I fix that?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

In order to fix the issue with the indentation of code blocks and additional
paragraphs inside a numbered list, you can add the following CSS to your
stylesheet:

```css
ol {
  counter-reset: list-item;
}

li {
  position: relative;
}

li > * {
  margin-left: 1.5em;
}

li::before {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  content: counter(list-item) ".";
  counter-increment: list-item;
  margin-right: 0.5em;
  text-align: right;
}
```

This CSS will create a custom counter for the list items, apply proper
indentation to all the elements inside the list items, and place the list item
numbers absolutely to the left of the content with correct alignment. This
should help keep your code blocks and additional paragraphs indented in line
with the first paragraph.

{{ user_msg() }}

No, that just made a mess of the numbering and didn't fix the indentation.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

I apologize for the confusion. Let's try another approach to indent the code
blocks and additional paragraphs under the same number entry in the ordered
list.

Add the following CSS to your stylesheet:

```css
ol li {
  padding-left: 1.5em;
  text-indent: -1.5em;
}

ol li > pre,
ol li > p:not(:first-child) {
  margin-left: 1.5em;
}
```

This CSS code will indent the list items with a **\`1.5em\`** padding and use a
negative text-indent to align the list numbers properly. It will also apply the
correct margin to the code blocks and any paragraphs after the first child
within the list items.

{{ user_msg() }}

That didn't work either.  It turns out that the Markdown numbering is turning
into \<ol\>\<li\>first paragraph\</ol\>\<pre\>code block\</pre\>\<p\>second
paragraph\<ol start="2"\>\<li\>second list item\</ol\>

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

I see the issue now. The code block and the following paragraphs are not within
the **\`\<li\>\`** tags, which is causing the indentation problems.

Unfortunately, this is a limitation of some Markdown parsers when generating
HTML output. The issue is that the Markdown parser interprets the code block as
a separate element and does not nest it within the **\`\<li\>\`** element.

One solution to handle this situation is to use raw HTML for your list items
when you have multiple paragraphs or code blocks within a single list item.
This would allow you to manually structure the **\`\<li\>\`** elements so that
they contain all the necessary content.

Here's an example of how you can structure the HTML:

```html
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First paragraph</p>
    <pre><code>Code block</code></pre>
    <p>Second paragraph</p>
  </li>
  <li>Second list item</li>
</ol>
```

In this example, the code block and the second paragraph are contained within
the first **\`\<li\>\`** element, which should maintain proper indentation for
all elements.

{{ user_msg() }}

Yes, but then the \`\`\` for the code block won't work inside the HMTL tags. Is
there a way to turn the Markdown processing back on inside the tags?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Unfortunately, you can't switch between Markdown and HTML within the same block
like that. However, you can still use the code block in HTML by using the
**\`\<pre\>\`** and **\`\<code\>\`** tags together, as shown in my previous
example.

Here's a workaround that uses HTML for the list elements and retains the code
block:

```html
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First paragraph</p>
    <pre><code>your_code_here
    another_line_of_code
    </code></pre>
    <p>Second paragraph</p>
  </li>
  <li>Second list item</li>
</ol>
```

Replace **\`your_code_here\`** and **\`another_line_of_code\`** with the
actual code you want to display. While this solution doesn't use the triple
backticks, it will still result in a properly formatted code block.

{{ last_msg() }}

Being forced to only use HTML just to be able wrap the Markdown output in
**\<ol\>** and **\<li\>** tags didn't sound good!  But then I had an
epiphany...

{{ first_msg() }}

Wait, I'm inside HTML tags from the shortcodes.  Maybe if I use shortcodes to
create the HTML tags instead?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Yes, using shortcodes to create the HTML tags can help solve the issue of the
indentation with the code block and additional paragraphs in your ordered list.
You can create shortcodes for the opening and closing **\`\<li\>\`** tags, and
use them within your Markdown content.

Here's an example of how you can create shortcodes for the list items:

1. Create a new shortcode file named **\`li_open.html\`** in the
   **\`templates/shortcodes\`** directory with the following content:

```html
<li>
```

1. Create another shortcode file named **\`li_close.html\`** in the same
   directory with the following content:

```html
</li>
```

Now, in your Markdown content, you can use these shortcodes to create the list
items:

```markdown
<ol>
  {{/* li_open() */}}
    First paragraph

    ```
    your_code_here
    another_line_of_code
    ```

    Second paragraph
  {{/* li_close() */}}
  {{/* li_open() */}}
    Second list item
  {{/* li_close() */}}
</ol>
```

By using shortcodes to open and close the **\`\<li\>\`** tags, you can continue
using the triple backticks for code blocks and preserve the Markdown formatting
for your content within the list items.

{{ user_msg() }}

Won't the \<ol\> disable the Markdown processing too?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

You're right, using the **\`\<ol\>\`** tag directly in your Markdown content
may cause issues with Markdown processing as well. To address this, you can
create additional shortcodes for the opening and closing **\`\<ol\>\`** tags.

1. Create a new shortcode file named **\`ol_open.html\`** in the
   **\`templates/shortcodes\`** directory with the following content:

```html
<ol>
```

1. Create another shortcode file named **\`ol_close.html\`** in the same
   directory with the following content:

```html
</ol>
```

Now, you can use these shortcodes in your Markdown content like this:

```markdown
{{/* ol_open() */}}
  {{/* li_open() */}}
    First paragraph

    ```
    your_code_here
    another_line_of_code
    ```

    Second paragraph
  {{/* li_close() */}}
  {{/* li_open() */}}
    Second list item
  {{/* li_close() */}}
{{/* ol_close() */}}
```

By using shortcodes for both the **\`\<ol\>\`** and **\`\<li\>\`** tags,
Markdown processing should work correctly within the list items.

{{ user_msg() }}

Yup, that works perfectly, though the {\{ li_close() }} isn't needed.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

I'm glad to hear that it works! Yes, you're right. Since the **\`\</li\>\`**
closing tag is optional in HTML, you can omit the {\{ li_close() }}
shortcode, and the browser will automatically close the **\`\<li\>\`** tags for
you.  Here's the revised version without the {\{ li_close() }} shortcode:

```markdown
{{/* ol_open() */}}
  {{/* li_open() */}}
    First paragraph

    ```
    your_code_here
    another_line_of_code
    ```

    Second paragraph
  {{/* li_open() */}}
    Second list item
{{/* ol_close() */}}
```

This should still work correctly and maintain proper Markdown processing within
the list items.

{{ last_msg() }}

This technique is much more workable.  In addition to removing the
**{\{ li_close() }}** shortcode because **\</li\>** is optional in HTML, I also
renamed **{\{ li_open() }}** to **{\{ li() }}** for simplicity.  I also added
corresponding **{\{ ul_open() }}** and **{\{ ul_close() }}** shortcodes for
unordered lists.

After this, I discussed the DeepThought theme's SASS file with ChatGPT, and how
to make the navigation bar stay in a fixed position at the top of the screen...

{{ first_msg() }}

Consider this "\_navbar.sass" file used by the DeepThought theme:

_\[Here I copied and pasted the SASS file in question.\]_

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

This **\`\_navbar.sass\`** file appears to be a SASS (Syntactically Awesome
Style Sheets) file containing styling rules for the navigation bar of the
DeepThought theme. SASS is a CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features
like variables, nested rules, and mixins.

The file starts by importing mixins and defining a set of variables related to
the navigation bar, such as colors, dimensions, and breakpoints. These
variables can be customized to change the appearance of the navigation bar.

The file then defines a series of styling rules for various elements and states
of the navigation bar, such as the navbar brand, tabs, menu, items, links,
dropdowns, and dividers. These rules cover different device sizes and screen
orientations through the use of media queries.

In general, this file contains the core styling of the navigation bar for the
DeepThought theme and can be customized to fit the specific needs of a project.

{{ user_msg() }}

Without adding any custom CSS rules of my own, how can I use the rules in that
SASS file to keep the navbar in a fixed position instead of scrolling off the
screen?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

To keep the navbar in a fixed position without adding any custom CSS rules, you
can leverage Bootstrap's built-in class for this purpose. Since you are using
SASS and assuming you have already imported the Bootstrap SASS file, all you
need to do is add the **\`.fixed-top\`** class to your navbar element in the
HTML markup. This will make the navbar fixed at the top of the page without
writing any additional CSS.

Here's how you can do it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <!-- Make sure to include the compiled CSS from your SASS file -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="your_compiled_css_file.css">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Add the .fixed-top class to your navbar element -->
  <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg fixed-top">
    <!-- Your navbar content goes here -->
  </nav>

  <!-- Your page content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

By adding the **\`.fixed-top\`** class to your navbar, it will remain fixed at
the top of the viewport when the user scrolls down the page.

{{ last_msg() }}

Bootstrap??  ChatGPT is making random assumptions again!

{{ first_msg() }}

Why are you assuming Bootstrap?  I just gave you the SASS file DeepThought uses
for the navbar.  Give an answer based ONLY on that file.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Apologies for the confusion. Based on the provided SASS file, you can make the
navbar fixed by using the existing styles. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, locate the class name that is being used for the navbar in your HTML
   file. For this example, let's assume the class name is
**\`.deepthought-navbar\`**.

2. In the SASS file you provided, add a new style rule for the
   **\`.deepthought-navbar\`** class to make it fixed at the top:

```css
.deepthought-navbar {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  z-index: 1030;
}
```

These styles will ensure that the navbar has a fixed position at the top of the
page, covers the full width of the viewport, and has a z-index high enough to
appear above most other elements on the page.

1. Compile the SASS file to generate the updated CSS file.

2. Make sure the updated CSS file is linked in your HTML file.

Now, the navbar should remain fixed at the top of the viewport when you scroll
down the page.

{{ user_msg() }}

I said without adding custom styles.  Only use classes and styles already
defined in the provided SASS file.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Apologies for misunderstanding your request earlier. Unfortunately, the
provided SASS file does not have any existing styles to create a fixed navbar
without adding any custom styles. If you cannot add custom styles, you will
need to rely on external libraries or frameworks that have built-in support for
fixed navbars, or consider modifying the SASS file to include the necessary
styles for a fixed navbar as mentioned in the previous response.

{{ last_msg() }}

Oh really??  That's funny, because I see one!

{{ first_msg() }}

What does "is-fixed-top" do in that SASS file?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

I apologize for my earlier oversight. Indeed, there is a class in the provided
SASS file called "is-fixed-top". This class can be used to create a fixed-top
navbar.

The "is-fixed-top" class sets the position of the element to "fixed", with a
"top" value of 0, and a "z-index" value of 30. This ensures that the navbar
will stay at the top of the page and not scroll off the screen, while appearing
above most other content on the page.

To use this class, simply add the "is-fixed-top" class to your navbar HTML
element:

```html
<nav class="navbar is-fixed-top">
  <!-- Your navbar content goes here -->
</nav>
```

This should keep the navbar in a fixed position at the top of the page, without
needing to add any custom styles.

{{ last_msg() }}

This is a simple solution that works.  However, it didn't work in the theme's
dark mode, even though I was using a CSS rule that was provided by the theme
itself!  Diving into this topic turned out to be a VERY deep rabbit hole...

{{ first_msg() }}

Now, I've already done that, and it works...  until I switch the theme to dark
mode, then it stops working.  Why?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

I apologize for the confusion earlier. I see that you are experiencing an issue
when switching to dark mode. The issue could be related to the **\`.is-dark\`**
class in the SASS file provided. It's possible that the styles for the
**\`.is-dark\`** class might be interfering with the **\`.is-fixed-top\`**
class.

To identify the issue, please check if the **\`.is-dark\`** class (or any other
class related to dark mode) is causing any style conflicts or overrides with
the **\`.is-fixed-top\`** class. Look for any CSS properties that might be
affecting the positioning or display of the fixed-top navbar in dark mode.

If you can provide more information about the specific styles applied in dark
mode or any relevant code, I would be happy to help further troubleshoot the
issue.

{{ user_msg() }}

It has to be interaction with these [theme="dark"] selectors in the "deep-thought.sass" file:

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Thank you for providing the relevant code. I see that the issue seems to be
caused by the following CSS rule in the "deep-thought.sass" file:

```css
body[theme="dark"]
    filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)
```

When the theme is switched to dark mode, this rule is applied to the entire
**\`body\`** element, inverting the colors and rotating the hue by 180 degrees.
However, this also affects child elements, such as the navbar with the
**\`.is-fixed-top\`** class. The filter applied to the **\`body\`** element
might be causing the fixed positioning of the navbar to stop working as
intended.

To resolve this issue, you can either:

1. Modify the dark theme styles to apply the filter individually to specific
   elements, instead of applying it to the entire **\`body\`** element. This
will help ensure that the filter does not interfere with the fixed positioning
of the navbar.

2. Add a new rule targeting the navbar specifically in dark mode to counteract
   the filter applied to the **\`body\`** element. This rule should apply the
opposite filter to the navbar, essentially canceling out the filter applied to
the **\`body\`**. For example:

```css
.is-fixed-top[theme="dark"]
    filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)
```

This rule will apply the same filter to the fixed-top navbar when the theme is
set to dark, counteracting the filter applied to the **\`body\`** element and
preserving the navbar's fixed positioning.

{{ last_msg() }}

Off on the wrong track again!

{{ first_msg() }}

I'm not trying to cancel out the dark mode, I'm trying to keep the
"is-fixed-top" style working.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

I apologize for the confusion. After reviewing the provided code, it seems that
the dark mode styles should not be directly affecting the **\`.is-fixed-top\`**
class behavior. The filter applied to the **\`body\`** element when the theme
is set to dark shouldn't affect the positioning of the navbar.

However, there might be an issue with how the dark mode is being applied in the
HTML structure or JavaScript implementation. To help identify the problem,
please provide the relevant HTML and JavaScript code used for switching between
the light and dark modes.

{{ user_msg() }}

It might be in here:

function documentReadyCallback() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;_\[Here I copied and pasted this JavaScript function.\]_<br>
};<br>
<br>
if (document.readyState === 'loading') {  // Loading hasn't finished yet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', documentReadyCallback);<br>
} else {  // \`DOMContentLoaded\` has already fired<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;documentReadyCallback();<br>
}

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Based on the code provided, it seems that when the theme is switched to dark
mode, the following styles are applied:

```javascript
document.body.setAttribute("theme", "dark");
document.querySelectorAll("img, picture, video, pre").forEach(img => img.setAttribute("theme", "dark"));
document.querySelectorAll(".vimeo, .youtube, .chart").forEach(video => video.setAttribute("theme", "dark"));
```

These lines add the **\`theme="dark"\`** attribute to the body, images,
picture, video, and pre elements, as well as to elements with the class names
"vimeo", "youtube", and "chart".

However, the provided code doesn't directly interact with the **\`.is-fixed-top
class\`**, and the dark mode styles from the "deep-thought.sass" file should
not affect the navbar's fixed positioning.

If the navbar stops being fixed in the dark mode, there might be an issue
outside of the provided code. It is also possible that some other styles or
scripts are affecting the behavior. To further investigate, please check the
browser's developer tools (like the Elements and Styles panels in Google
Chrome) to inspect the styles applied to the navbar when the theme is switched
to dark mode. This might help identify any unexpected styles that could be
causing the issue.

{{ user_msg() }}

Here are the HTML elements in dark mode:

_\[Here I copied and pasted the relevant HTML.\]_

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Based on the provided HTML code, the navbar has the **\`is-fixed-top\`** and
**\`is-light\`** classes applied to it. When you switch to dark mode, the
following styles from the "deep-thought.sass" file are applied to the body:

```css
body[theme="dark"] {
    filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);
}
```

However, this filter should not affect the fixed positioning of the navbar. As
previously mentioned, the provided code doesn't directly interact with the
**\`.is-fixed-top\`** class, and the dark mode styles should not affect the
navbar's fixed positioning.

To help you debug this issue, I would recommend the following steps:

1. Inspect the navbar element in your browser's developer tools when in dark
   mode. Check the applied styles and see if any styles conflict with the fixed
positioning.

2. Temporarily disable the dark mode JavaScript code and see if the issue
   persists. This will help you determine if the issue is related to the dark
mode code or not.

If the issue still persists after trying these steps, it might be necessary to
look at other parts of your code or stylesheets that could be affecting the
fixed positioning of the navbar in dark mode.

{{ user_msg() }}

When I click on that top-level \<nav\> element, it does say the computed style
is "position: fixed".  However, at the next level down in \<div
class="container"\>, it says "position: relative" and points to this
"deep-thought.css" rule:
<br>
<br>
.container {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flex-grow: 1;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;margin: 0 auto;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;position: relative;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width: auto<br>
}

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

The **\`position: relative\`** style on the **\`.container\`** div should not
be causing the issue with the fixed positioning of the navbar. A **\`position:
relative\`** style on a child element does not affect the positioning of the
parent element. In this case, the parent element is the **\`\<nav\>\`** element
with the **\`is-fixed-top\`** class.

However, if you still suspect that the **\`position: relative\`** style on the
**\`.container\`** div is causing the issue, you can try overriding it for the
specific case of the navbar container. Add the following custom CSS rule to
your stylesheet:

```css
.navbar.is-fixed-top .container {
    position: static;
}
```

This CSS rule targets the **\`.container\`** div that is a child of a
**\`.navbar.is-fixed-top\`** element and sets its position to **\`static\`**,
which is the default value.

Please note that this custom CSS rule may not be necessary, as the
**\`position: relative\`** style on the **\`.container\`** div should not cause
issues with the fixed positioning of the parent **\`\<nav\>\`** element.
However, you can try this rule to see if it resolves the issue you are
experiencing.

{{ user_msg() }}

If the \<nav\> element was computed as "fixed", what else could be overriding
that?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

If the **\`\<nav\>\`** element's computed position is **\`fixed\`**, it is
unlikely that the issue is caused by the positioning itself. However, other
factors may be causing the navbar to behave unexpectedly. Here are a few
possibilities to consider:

{{ ol_open() }}

{{ li() }} **z-index**: The navbar might be positioned correctly, but it could
be hidden behind other elements on the page due to a lower z-index. Check if
there are any elements with higher z-index values that could be overlapping the
navbar. You can try setting a higher z-index value for the navbar to ensure it
stays on top of other elements:

```css
.navbar.is-fixed-top {
    z-index: 1000; /* or any sufficiently high value */
}
```

{{ li() }} **Dark mode filter**: The dark mode filter applied to the
**\`body\`** element might be causing some unexpected behavior. It uses
**\`filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)\`**, which could lead to odd visual
effects in some cases. Try disabling the filter temporarily to see if the issue
persists.

{{ li() }} **JavaScript interference**: Some JavaScript code on your page might
be interfering with the navbar's behavior. Review your JavaScript code and
disable any scripts temporarily to see if the issue still occurs. If you find
the problematic script, you can further investigate and modify it to ensure it
doesn't affect the navbar.

{{ ol_close() }}

If none of these solutions work, it would be helpful to have a live example or
a more detailed description of the issue you are experiencing. This would allow
for more accurate troubleshooting and guidance.

{{ user_msg() }}

I found the following documentation on
https://bulma.io/documentation/components/navbar/#fixed-navbar

Fixed navbar#<br>
You can now fix the navbar to either the top or bottom of the page. This is a
2-step process:

Add either is-fixed-top or is-fixed-bottom to the navbar component<br>
\<nav class="navbar is-fixed-top"\><br>
Add the corresponding has-navbar-fixed-top or has-navbar-fixed-bottom modifier
to either <html> or <body> element to provide the appropriate padding to the
page<br>
\<html class="has-navbar-fixed-top"\><br>
Try it out!

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

I apologize for not mentioning this earlier. You're right, Bulma does have
built-in support for fixed navbars. Following the two-step process described in
the documentation should solve the issue:

1. Add **\`is-fixed-top\`** to the **\`\<nav\>\`** element, which you've
   already done:

```html
<nav aria-label="section navigation" class="navbar is-fixed-top is-light" role="navigation">
```

1. Add the **\`has-navbar-fixed-top\`** class to the **\`\<html\>\`** or
   **\`\<body\>\`** element:

```html
<html class="has-navbar-fixed-top">
```

The **\`has-navbar-fixed-top\`** class provides the necessary padding to
prevent content from being hidden behind the fixed navbar when scrolling. This
should work as expected, even when switching between light and dark modes.

Make sure to include the Bulma CSS in your project for these classes to work.
If the issue persists, please let me know and provide more details about the
problem you are facing.

{{ user_msg() }}

DeepThought says it's based on Bulma.  I added the "has-navbar-fixed-top" to
the \<body\> tag and that works for the padding, allowing me to remove the
\<div\> I had manually added to accomplish the same padding.  Dark mode still
allows the navbar to scroll off the screen.

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Thank you for the clarification. Based on the information provided, it appears
that the issue lies in the interaction between the dark mode theme and the
fixed navbar. Since the dark mode is achieved by applying **\`filter: invert(1)
hue-rotate(180deg)\`** to the **\`body[theme="dark"]\`** selector in the SASS
file, it might be affecting the fixed positioning of the navbar.

One possible solution is to separate the navbar from the **\`body\`** element
in the DOM and apply the dark mode filter only to the content container,
leaving the navbar unaffected. You can modify the HTML structure as follows:

```html
<body>
  <nav aria-label="section navigation" class="navbar is-fixed-top is-light" role="navigation">
    ...
  </nav>
  <div id="content-container">
    <!-- All other content goes here -->
  </div>
</body>
```

And then modify the SASS file to apply the dark mode filter only to the content
container:

```css
#content-container[theme="dark"] {
    filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);
}
```

Remember to update the JavaScript code that sets the "theme" attribute for the
dark mode as well:

```javascript
if (localStorage.getItem("theme") === "dark") {
  document.getElementById("content-container").setAttribute("theme", "dark");
  ...
}
```

And for toggling the dark mode:

```javascript
document.getElementById("dark-mode").addEventListener("click", () => {
  ...
  if (localStorage.getItem("theme") == "dark") {
    ...
    document.getElementById("content-container").removeAttribute("theme", "dark");
  } else {
    ...
    document.getElementById("content-container").setAttribute("theme", "dark");
  }
});
```

This should prevent the dark mode from affecting the fixed positioning of the
navbar while still applying the dark mode theme to the rest of the page
content. If the issue still persists, please let me know so we can investigate
further.

{{ user_msg() }}

Why would the dark mode have any effect if it's not using "position" CSS rules?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

You are correct that the dark mode styles don't directly use "position" CSS
rules. However, the **\`filter\`** property applied to the
**\`body[theme="dark"]\`** selector may still have unintended side effects when
combined with other styles, such as **\`position: fixed\`**.

Upon further investigation, it seems that the issue is likely not related to
the dark mode styles themselves, but rather to the stacking context of the
elements on the page. The **\`filter\`** property creates a new stacking
context, which can cause the fixed-position navbar to be positioned relative to
the filtered body element instead of the viewport.

To resolve this issue, you can add a high **\`z-index\`** value to the
**\`.navbar\`** class in your SASS file to ensure that the navbar is always
rendered on top of other elements, regardless of the stacking context:

```css
.navbar {
  z-index: 9999; // You can adjust this value as needed
}
```

Adding the **\`z-index\`** property should help to ensure that the fixed navbar
stays in place when the dark mode is active. Please try this solution and let
me know if it resolves the issue.

{{ user_msg() }}

It already had a z-index of 30, was that insufficient?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

A **\`z-index\`** of 30 should generally be sufficient to keep the navbar on
top of other elements on the page. However, if there are other elements with a
higher **\`z-index\`** value or if the stacking context is affected by other
CSS properties (such as the **\`filter\`** property in the dark mode), it's
possible that a higher **\`z-index\`** value might be required.

You can try increasing the **\`z-index\`** value for the **\`.navbar\`** class
to see if that resolves the issue. However, it's also possible that there might
be another underlying cause for the scrolling issue in dark mode.

If increasing the **\`z-index\`** value doesn't resolve the issue, please let
me know so we can continue investigating the problem.

{{ last_msg() }}

Google searches turned up a discussion about a similar issue and the problem
does appear to be caused by the creation of a new stacking context by the
filter.  However, it also appears to be a very difficult issue to resolve, so I
decided to just leave it broken for now.

Next, I shifted to discussing how to use GitHub Pages for free hosting...

{{ first_msg() }}

How would I need to setup the git repositories to host codereflections.com on
GitHub Pages?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

Hosting a website on GitHub Pages is fairly straightforward. Here's the
step-by-step process:

1. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.

2. Create a new repository. The repository should be named in the format
   **\`username.github.io\`**, replacing **\`username\`** with your GitHub
username. For example, if your username is **\`codereflections\`**, you would
create a repository named **\`codereflections.github.io\`**.

3. Push your website's files to this new repository. Your HTML files, CSS,
   JavaScript, images, etc., should all be pushed to this repository. Note that
GitHub Pages uses the main branch as the publishing source for your site.

4. Access your website. Once you've pushed your website's files to the
   **\`username.github.io\`** repository, your website should be accessible at
**\`https://username.github.io\`**.

To use a custom domain like **\`codereflections.com\`**, follow these
additional steps:

1. Purchase a domain name. You can purchase a domain name from a domain name
   registrar such as Google Domains, Namecheap, or GoDaddy.

2. Configure your domain. You'll need to add a CNAME file to your GitHub
   repository and configure the DNS settings with your domain name registrar to
point to GitHub's servers. The CNAME file should contain only the domain name
**\`codereflections.com\`** and nothing else. In your DNS settings, you would
add a CNAME record for the www subdomain pointing to
**\`username.github.io\`**, and four A records for the apex domain pointing to
the IP addresses provided by GitHub.

More details on these steps can be found in the GitHub Pages documentation:
**<https://docs.github.com/en/pages>**

Remember that GitHub Pages is intended for static websites. If your website
uses server-side code (like PHP or Node.js), it won't work on GitHub Pages. In
that case, you would need to look into different hosting options such as
Heroku, Vercel, or Netlify.

{{ user_msg() }}

In this case, the username on GitHub is "code-reflections" because of the
namesquatter on "codereflections".

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

If your username on GitHub is **\`code-reflections\`**, then you would create a
repository named **\`code-reflections.github.io\`**.

Here's the updated step-by-step process:

1. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one already. You already have an
   account named **\`code-reflections\`**.

2. Create a new repository. The repository should be named
   **\`code-reflections.github.io\`**.

3. Push your website's files to this new repository. Your HTML files, CSS,
   JavaScript, images, etc., should all be pushed to this repository. Note that
GitHub Pages uses the main branch as the publishing source for your site.

4. Access your website. Once you've pushed your website's files to the
   **\`code-reflections.github.io\`** repository, your website should be
accessible at **\`https://code-reflections.github.io\`**.

To use a custom domain like **\`codereflections.com\`**, follow these
additional steps:

1. Purchase a domain name. You can purchase a domain name from a domain name
   registrar such as Google Domains, Namecheap, or GoDaddy.

2. Configure your domain. You'll need to add a CNAME file to your GitHub
   repository and configure the DNS settings with your domain name registrar to
point to GitHub's servers. The CNAME file should contain only the domain name
**\`codereflections.com\`** and nothing else. In your DNS settings, you would
add a CNAME record for the www subdomain pointing to
**\`code-reflections.github.io\`**, and four A records for the apex domain
pointing to the IP addresses provided by GitHub.

This will allow your site to be accessed via **\`codereflections.com\`**
instead of **\`code-reflections.github.io\`**.

{{ user_msg() }}

Should the files be in the "main" branch or another branch?

{{ chatgpt_msg() }}

For a user or organization page (like **\`code-reflections.github.io\`**), the
files should be on the **\`main\`** branch. This is because, by default, GitHub
Pages uses the **\`main\`** branch for publishing your website.

However, for project pages, you have the option to use either the **\`main\`**
branch, the **\`gh-pages\`** branch, or the **\`/docs\`** folder on the
**\`main\`** branch.

Since you are creating a user page, stick with the **\`main\`** branch. Just
make sure your primary HTML file is named **\`index.html\`** as this is what
GitHub Pages will look to serve as the root of your site.
